The project involves organizing an international conference on ecological democracy and community rights for 200 participants in Sri Lanka. Local communities in the global South lack decision-making power over the natural resources surrounding them. As a r
esult, many communities have become marginalized victims of modern development and environmental damage caused by it. Ecological democracy provides a framework that would enable community participation in decision-making over local environment in their own
 terms, instead of those of companies or officials. In order to make  informed decisions and act accordingly, the communities and grassroots organizations need better access to environmental information. The two-day conference will be held in the turn of S
eptember-October 2014 in Kandy, Sri Lanka. The conference precedes a general meeting of Friends of the Earth International (FoEI), which will be held in the same place. Half of the participants in the conference will be local activists and community repres
entatives, and the other half FoEI network members from 76 countries. The implementing organization, Centre for Environmental Justice, is FoEI 's member organization in Sri Lanka. The conference enables exchanging information and experiences  on environmen
tal problems and democratic management of enviroment between local actors and those coming from different parts of the world. A declaration and action plan to achieve ecological democracy will be made in the conference, and afterwards a publication on the 
conference presentations and discussions will be published. The conference will enhance the capacities of local communities to act on behalf of their environmental and other basic rights and sustainable livelihoods, as well as support international network
ing of the environmental movement in Sri Lanka. Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ) was established in January 2004. CEJ aims to protect the equal environmental rights of the people, conserve nature and natural resources, support ecologically sound comm
unity activities, promote good environmental governance and ecological sustainability. CEJ provides free legal advice to the people affected by environmental problems, campaigns against e.g. environmental pollutants and climate change, and raises awareness
 on environmental impact assessment processes and the environmental outcomes of development initiatives. CEJ is a member of the Friends of the Earth International and functions as the Friends of t

GHRI funded the Teasdale-Corti Global Health Research Partnership Program, which closed in 2012. This project will provide funding for Dr Sanjeev Sridharan to present the final program evaluation in Ottawa to the funders: 
- Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada
-Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)
-IDRC

The Evaluation Centre for Complex Health Interventions at the University of Toronto designed the evaluation in collaboration with IDRC and CIHR.

Evaulating the Teasdale-Corti research
The Teasdale-Corti program's objectives were to:
-foster international partnerships and collaboration to promote the generation, communication and use of relevant health research in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs);
-train and support researchers responsive to LMICs' health policy and practice priorities; and,
-promote active collaboration between researchers and research users to support health priorities in LMICs.

Its four program areas included: health policy and system research, prevention and control of pandemics, prevention and control of chronic diseases, and interactions of health, environment, and development.

IDRC's Evaluation Unit assessed the evaluation as being of good quality. The evaluation provides more than 20 recommendations at three levels: the program's theory of change, future versions of the program, and associated calls for proposals. The presentation will allow GHRI to share the learning and results of this evaluation.",4.0,,,2013-11-18,2013-12-18,International Development Research Centre,,Other Public Sector,15.0,Canada.

To achieve these goals, DPSP-2 supports wide-ranging reforms in four core areas to (i) improve macroeconomic stability and creditworthiness, (ii) promote investments, (iii) strengthen the public financial management and anticorruption framework, and (iv) improve the delivery of public services.

Union to Union (f.d. LO-TCO Biståndsnämnd) ansöker om rambidrag för 2017 på 135,1 MSEK för projekt och programverksamhet i utvecklingsländer och Östeuropa, inklusive administrations- och vidareförmedlingsbidrag där den totala budgeten uppgår till 153,0 MSEK inklusive en egeninsats på 14 %. Ansökan avser en ettårig förlängning av den verksamhet som genomförs under avtalsperioden 2014-2016. Vid en jämförelse av det sökta beloppet för 2017 och anslaget för 2016 på 119,9 MSEK (enligt andra avtalsändring av underavtal daterat 2016-11-21) motsvarar det ansökta beloppet en ökning på knappt 13 %. Union to Union förklarar ökningen främst med hänvisning till ett par gemensamma faktorer inom verksamhetens 11 sektorer. Den första rör valutakurser, där den svenska kronan tappat i förhållande till både CHF (Swiss Franc) och USD. Den andra faktorn är förknippad med att deras samarbetsparter drabbats av att andra givare dragit ner sitt stöd till den fackliga verksamheten medan behoven har kvarstått. Därutöver lyfter man att det krympande utrymmet för civilsamhället att verka innebär större utmaningar än tidigare. I ansökan för 2017 finns också ett par nya initiativ föreslagna i form av ett policyprogram avseende Agenda 2030 och den fackliga rörelsen (1 MSEK) och en s.k. Innovationsfond (0,5 MSEK) med syfte att kunna möta oförutsedda behov under året.

Union to Unions vision för verksamheten är att det i alla länder finns oberoende, demokratiska och jämställda fackliga organisationer som har kapacitet att företräda sina medlemmars intressen. De vill uppnå detta genom att arbeta med erfarenhetsutbyten och utbildning i fackliga och mänskliga rättigheter i arbetslivet, ledarskap inom fackliga organisationer, arbetsmiljö, jämställdhet, social dialog och hiv/aids.

Sida beslutar att bevilja Union to Union 120 MSEK för verksamheten 2017. Skälen är följande:

	Sida bedömer att Union to Union är en viktig aktör inom det fackliga arbetet och stödet till arbetstagarorganisationer i utvecklingsländer genom sitt globala nätverk av fackliga organisationer (Global Union Federations) och sin plattform i Sverige genom de svenska medlemsorganisationernas fackförbund. 

	Sida bedömer att den i ansökan 2017 föreslagna verksamheten är relevant under strategin Stöd genom svenska organisationer i det civila samhället 2016-2022 (CSO-strategin) eftersom att den relaterar till strategins övergripande syfte ""att arbeta för ett livskraftigt och pluralistiskt civilt samhälle i utvecklingsländer"" och till strategins båda övergripande målområden, dvs. 1) Stärkt kapacitet hos det civila samhället i utvecklingsländer och 2) Främjande av ett gynnsamt samhällsklimat för civilsamhället i utvecklingsländer. 

	Union to Union har varit ramorganisation till Sida sedan 1977 och Sidas erfarenhet av samarbetet med Union to Union är överlag god. 

	Då ansökan avser en ettårig förlängning av den verksamhet som genomförs under avtalsperioden 2014-2016 bedömer Sida att nivån på anslaget för 2017 bör ligga på ungefär samma nivå som anslaget för 2016. Givet den samlade bilden på anslaget bedömer Sida att Union to Unions ansökan om höjt anslag på ca 13 % inte föranleder Sida att höja anslaget för 2017. Sida föreslår att bidrag till den s.k. Innovationsfonden inte beviljas då presenterat underlag inte uppfyller kraven i Sidas insatshanteringsregel. 
 
BEREDNINGEN AV ANSÖKAN

Då ansökan för 2017 avser en förlängning av verksamheten under avtalsperioden 2014-2016 bereds insatsen som ett kompletterande insatsbeslut. Sida har därför i så stor utsträckning som möjligt utgått från den beredning som gjordes av ansökan för avtalsperioden 2014-2016. I den utsträckning som denna bedömts vara fortsatt relevant har bedömningen behållits och endast en kompletterande kommentar gällande 2017 har lagts till. I vissa fall, är bedömningen som gjordes i beredningen av den förra ansökan inte längre relevant, varför en ny bedömning har gjorts.

Vietnam is one of more than 40 countries where Oxfam is developing anational inequality campaign. The inequality campaign in Vietnam runss from 2016 to 2019. The four-year campaign focuses on promoting public debates on the need to combat extreme inequalities, raising public awareness of the issue, enhancing the roles of CSOs in addressing inequalities and contributing to discussions and the progressive changes policies that address inequalities. The long-term goal of the campaign is that by 2019 there will be improvement on policy development/execution (or legislative change/policy change) to fight inequality and more effective re-distributive measures to address poverty and gender injustice. This will be backed up by solid evidences that extreme inequality is wrong, and stands in the way of people claiming their rights.

The 1st phase of  the EiU campaign in Vietnam (2016-2018) has conducted several studies on inequality in Vietnam as well as people's perception on this issues. These studies have provided important input to campaign activities which have succeeded in  increasing people's awareness on the general concept of inequality and the need to tackle it. This next phase (2018-2019)of the campaign will specify the issue of inequality so that citizens can feel its relevance, practise the values of equality as well as advocate for the changes in policies that will solve the causes of inequality and sustainable reduce the gap between the richest and  poorest group.  This phase aims to create a discourse on inequality in the society and bring solving inequality into the government's agenda.

Oxfam is seeking to make the progress on three areas towards meeting this goal which are as follows:

- Shifting the debates and creating the new discourseamong the policy makers, media and citizen to make greater change possible from now until 2019. The debate will include the increasing gap between the rich and the poor, state budget mobilisation through the fair fiscal system with the focus on women and girls, labors' rights
- Inspire youth led campaign groups  and CSOs to pay attention to inequality and support to enhance their roles in addressing inequality in public
- Policy progress about the inequality in accessing quality social services (health) through more transparent and accountable information sharing mechanisms about state budget mobilisation and allocation to social services.

Expected outcomes:
- A comprehensive campaign strategy to direct the communication activities in 2018 and 2019
- An established equalitycoalition empowered to promote equality values and changes in policies to tackle inequality.

As per UNOCHA, out of 5 million persons who were displaced from FATA and KP, more than 90% have returned to their places of origin. NWA is one of the most affected FATA agencies with 190,219 extremely vulnerable individuals (women, children and others) within the returning IDPs, with more returnees expected in 2018.Rapid Needs assessment in the field by NCA/PADO in Nov 2017 helped to validate the secondary data. The proposed humanitarian action will provide WASH assistance to support 30,002 of the most vulnerable returnees including 500 children in 10 schools and 5000 Out Patient Department (OPD) patients in 5 health centers in 11 villages of 3 tehsils - Mir Ali, Miran Shah and Spinwam in NWA. By ensuring a more hygienic environment, the action will improve health outcomes related to poor WASH conditions and practices such as the incidence of cholera and diarrhea.This will be done in a participatory manner by rehabilitating 4 communal and 15 institutional water supply schemes (WSS) and constructing 280 latrines in households, schools and health centers (including 50 latrines for persons with disabilities). The repair of WSS and latrine construction will be undertaken. The provision of technical advice and supervision by NCA and partner staff will also enable the beneficiaries to meet their other emergency needs for future shocks. Targeted beneficiaries will be encouraged to adopt improved hygiene practices, including menstrual hygiene management, throughschools campaigns and training of health workers.

The stateless students and women are having problems on personal legal status and citizenship, making them not equally access to rights to education, health care, travel, scholarship and decent work. Major causes of the problems are their lack of knowledge and understanding on personal legal status verification processes, ineffective enforcement of the law by authorities and unavailability of necessary law and policies.
The project aims to get their names registered with 13 digits identification number in order to access the government services such as rights to education, health care, travel and decent work and that they are equally treated.&nbsp;
The project objectives are that the students and their families receive the highest legal status and are able to access their rights.
The project expects the students including their families to obtain legal status including nationality for a minimum number of 300-500 persons per year in 4 target districts including other register offices.
Activities include data survey and development, training for stateless student&rsquo;s volunteers and women groups, mobile counseling services, legal clinic, stateless women group empowerment, coordination with authorities in relevant district offices, network building at targeted communities and policy advocacy.
Focus thematic areas are statelessness and personal legal status and citizenship and women empowerment.

Aim: Men and women enjoy equal rights, opportunities, access to information, and government services in Northern Shan State.
Objective: By end of 2020, 3,184 men and women in 16 ethnic villages in two townships have improved capacity to lead their own development and improved access to health and social services.
Problem Analysis: For women; lack of opportunities, lack of social protection, lack of women&rsquo;s self-help competences, lack of access to health care in combination with their reproductive role, stereotypes the &lsquo;people&rsquo; have and the domination of men are root causes for gender inequality.
For ethnic groups; the following root causes contributed to ethnic inequality whereby minority groups are marginalized: lack of opportunities, lack of social services, lack of awareness on ethnic rights, not being included in business opportunities as well as being dominated by Burmese and fearing to lose their ethnic identity.
Result 1: Community Health Workers and Health Insurance Funds are functioning.
Result 2: SHGs are functioning and members completed business training and started individual or group business.
Result 3: VDC&rsquo;s completed training on leadership skills, PCM, community organizing, human rights, gender, land law and developed VAPs.
Result 4: Community, in particular youth, has improved awareness on safe migration, acquiring legal documents and trafficking.
Result 5: Local Partner Organizations have improved capacity.

-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basic health services, including pregnant and lactating mothers, nutrition, family planning, HIV/Aids and TB awareness

Syftet med fonden är att finansiera mindre initiativ som är strategiska för genomförandet av strategin för utvecklingssamarbete med Kambodja, men som faller utanför ramverket för de större insatserna inom respektive resultatområde/sektor. 

Initiativ som finansieras via fonden är förstudier inför eventuella beredningar, utvärderingar, seminarier, studieresor, översättningar och publikationer. Fonden finansierar kostnader för flygbiljetter, visum,språktester och översättning i samband med kambodianst deltagande i Sidas International Training Programme (ITP), samt ramavtal för revisionstjänster som faller utanför de revisioner som avtalats med samarbetspartners, inklusive systemrevisioner och tolkning av revisionsrapporter. 

Varje enskilt initiativ (komponent i PLUS) bör vara begränsad i tid och i sin utformning och kopplad till tydliga resultat. 

The purpose with the Strategic Fund is to to finance smaller initiatives which are strategic for the the implementation of the Development Cooperation Strategy for Cambodia, but that fall outside the framework of the larger contributions in the respective result areas/sectors. 

Initiatives that can be financed through the Strategic Fund are preparatory studies prior to possible assessments, reviews and evaluations, study visits, translations and publications. The Strategic Fund finances costs for air travel, visa application, English tests and translations in connection with Cambodian participants in Sidas International Training Programmes (ITP), and frame agreements for audit services that fall outside the regular audits that have agreed with the cooperation partners, including system audits and interpretation of audit reports. 

Each individual initiative (component) should be limited in time and scope, and have clear expected results. 

The procedures for the Strategic Fund are as follows: 
1) The Programme Administrator is responsible for the overall management of the contribution. 
2) The Programme Officer writes a separate decision for a PLUS component in word format 
3) The Programme Officer is responsible for follow-up of the components 
4) The decision and documentation is archived under Strategic Fund.",4,,,2015-01-01,2017-01-28,Internal decision Letter of Co,,,,Sweden,SE-0,Government,10,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency,SE-6,Government,10,Private sector in recipient country,62000.0,Foundation,60.0,KH,Cambodia,100.0,,,,15111,Public finance management,100,,1,1.0,110.0,10.0,C01,5.0,USD,,23726.762601,7955.147548000001,0.0,0,0.0,0,0

The Finnish Refugee Council is a specialist in international refugee work. Its mission is to improve the basic rights of refugees and returnees. As an associate of the UNHCR in Finland the Council is a religiously and politically independent development co
operation organisation. Founded in 1965 the Finnish Refugee Council has been involved in development cooperation work globally providing adult education and youth welfare services in refugee camps in a range of countries. The Council also supports returnee
 communities in societies recovering from crises. In Finland the Council?s roles are mainly informational educational and social. The Finnish Refugee Council?s information services offer background information on international refugees and raise awareness 
about refugees and their lives both in global crisis areas and in Finland. The services also provide information on the work of the Finnish Refugee Council. Fundraising is also a fundamental aspect of the Council?s work. Donations are used for the organisa
tion?s work and are channelled to address the world?s refugee crises through the UNHCR.In 2013 Finnish Refugee Council was selected to receive programme support of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland including its development education and informat
ion work. In addition the Council receives organisational support for its general activities.

Plan Sverige har inkommit med en ansökan om rambidrag på sammanlagt 452 000 000 kr för en 3,5-årsperiod som börjar i januari 2015 och fortsätter till 30 juni 2018. Anledningen till att avtalsperioden föreslås vara 3,5 år är att Sida har ställt sig positivt till att anpassa avtalsperioden och rapporteringsschemat till Plan Sveriges brutna räkenskapsår. Budgeten för verksamheten ligger på en högre nivå än tidigare år, och ett godkännande av den föreslagna budgetnivån skulle innebära en höjning av rambidraget med drygt 28 procent (från drygt 101 MSEK per år till 130 MSEK per år). Sida bedömer att ökningen är välplanerad och bygger på styrkorna i tidigare program. Ansökan är skriven i enlighet med instruktionen för stöd under Strategin för stöd genom det svenska civilsamhället. Sida bedömer att ansökan är komplett och att verksamheten är relevant i förhållande till strategin.

Ansökande organisation:
Plan Sverige är en del av den internationella barnrättsfederationen Plan International som har verksamhet och landkontor i över 50 länder i Afrika, Asien och Latinamerika. Plan Sverige grundades 1997 och är en av 21 nationella organisationer i Plan-federationen. Plan Sverige är en stiftelse (inte en medlemsorganisation). Däremot har organisationen ett starkt nätverk av faddrar som varje år bidrar med mer än 60 procent av organisationens budget. Medlen från fadderverksamheten ger Plan (både internationellt och i Sverige) en stabilitet som ger möjligheter att fastanställa personal oberoende av eventuell kortsiktighet hos givare, samt betala för budgetposter som tidvis är svåra att samla in medel till. Plan Sverige har varit ramorganisation sedan 2006 (förnyad ramstatus 2014) och Sidas samlade erfarenhet av ramsamarbetet är god. På senare år har organisationen även fått status som strategisk partner för Sidas humanitära enhet och ECHO-status för samarbete med EU i humanitära frågor. 

Plan Sverige har under de senaste åren stärkt sin personalstyrka, och närmare 20 personer är på olika sätt delaktiga i att hantera ramanslaget. Av dessa är sju regionsamordnare, fem tematiska rådgivare, en programekonom, en verksamhetscontroller på heltid (ny tjänst), chefer, samordnare av institutionella givare och administrativ personal.

Plan Sverige samarbetar med Plan Internationals landkontor för insatsen, och landkontoren fungerar både som vidareförmedlare till civilsamhällesorganisationer och som genomförare av delar av programmet. Beredningen av insatsen har i största möjliga mån försökt bedöma landkontorens kapacitet i båda dessa roller. 

Sida bedömer att Plan Sverige fortsatt är en relevant partner i ramsamabetet med kapacitet att hantera ramanslag från Sida.

Ansökan:
Ansökan för perioden 2015-2018 har till syfte att ""barn och ungdomar, tillsammans med civilsamhället, kräver sina rättigheter från ansvarstagare som aktivt engagerar sig för att respektera, skydda och uppfylla dessa rättigheter"" (fritt översatt). Verksamheten ska ske i 19 länder, fyra regionala initiativ samt ett globalt program för påverkansarbete och innovation. Plan Sveriges ansökan är i stort en fortsättning på den verksamhet som organisationen haft under de senaste fyra åren under två avtal: Ramavtalet och avtalet gällande regeringens satsning på barns och ungdomars rätt till hälsa och utbildning. Nuvarande ansökan har för första gången helt integrerat de två ansatserna, och har resulterat i fem tematiska resultatområden/program:

1. Barns och ungdomars rätt till skydd från våld
2. Barns och ungdomars rätt till sexuell och reproduktiv hälsa
3. Barns och ungdomars medborgarskap och samhällsstyrning
4. Barnrättsstyrning
5. Barns rättigheter i katastrofsituationer (riskförebyggande och motståndskraft)

Sida bedömer att programmet är väl sammansatt, bygger på Plan Sveriges och Plan Internationals styrkor och på väl beprövande metoder - tillsammans med en vilja att hitta innovativa sätt att nå ännu bättre resultat.

This project will address the problem by assessing and testing public policies that can drive productivity and competitiveness.

Gaps persist despite growth
Poverty has declined substantially in Peru, but continues to affect 20% of the population. It is primarily concentrated in rural and remote regions. One in four Peruvians lives in these areas, and almost half of them are poor. Economic growth has failed to reduce gaps in opportunities for the country's young citizens, and its rural and indigenous women. This has caused a middle-income trap. The economic slowdown and the downward trend in investment will make the situation worse.

Testing policies for change
The July 2016 change in government and parliament offers an opportunity to address social gaps. This project will support collaboration among researchers, central and regional governments, and the private sector in Peru. Together, they will assess and test public policies to drive productivity and competitiveness. The goal is to promote innovative economic, social, and environmental policies.

The project will also enhance technical and financial collaboration between the 48 research institution members of the Peruvian Consorcio de Investigacio¿n Economica y Social and the National Council for Science and Technology. These organizations are working to develop applied social research and quality data for effective policy interventions at the national and local levels.

Thanks to its strong experience in welcoming asylum seekers, Caritas International was well placed to identify the specific needs of women migrants who experiment extreme difficulties once they find themselves unprotected and outside of their country of origin. They carry a heavy past since many of them had to flee their country faraway from their relatives either because they were victims of violence, armed conflicts or discriminations. Traumatized and isolated, they had to bear the exile, the constraints of asylum application, the financial distress while trying to go beyond their traumatism and to take care of their health and children.

For the supply of helda beans (snijboontjes or runner beans) Bakker Barendrecht BV is dependent on produce from Morocco and Spain. Because the Helda bean is sensitive to warm and cold, and Morocco and Spain have cold winters sometimes, the quality and quantity of beans from these countries is not always sufficient. Therefore, Bakker Barendrecht BV has explored possibilities to start production in Senegal.

Local partner, Safina SARL, is a family owned company and produces (amongst others) French beans for Bakker Barendrecht BV / Albert Heijn. The partners have done successful tests on a small scale and results are promising.

In European winters, there is a high demand and low supply of helda beans in the Netherlands. Therefore prices are relatively high in this period. The partners will form a joint venture to start producing helda beans for this period on the farm of Safina SARL, just outside Dakar. The beans will be cultivated in 20 modern plastic greenhouses of 1 ha each.

The project will employ 162 people (partly part-time) and most seasonal (6 months per year). It is estimated that this corresponds with 69 FTE on annual basis. The operation will be BSCI and GlobalGAP certified. It is expected that other companies in the sector will follow producing these beans, after the pilot turns out to be successful. The project is also positive for Senegal's negative trade balance, as the helda beans are cultivated for the export market.",3.0,2013-01-01,2017-12-31,2013-01-01,2018-06-28,Netherlands Enterprise Agency,NL-KVK-27378529,Government,10.0,Netherlands Enterprise Agency,NL-KVK-27378529,Government,10.0,,,,,"Safina SARL, Senegal",,Private Sector,70.0,SN,Senegal,100,,,,31161,Food crop production,100,,1,,110.0,,,5.0,EUR,EUR,674717.00,674717.00,0,674717.00,0.0,0,0

Specifically, the Program will seek to: (i) reduce the cost of borrowing and expand access to credit by improving the framework for secured transactions, (ii) protect depositors from poor governance practices in banks, (iii) enhance the role of the non-bank financial (NBF) sector in savings mobilization for investment capital, and (iv) improve investor confidence by reducing the risks from potential money laundering through the financial system.

The Program has three main components: (i) banking sector; (ii) NBF sector; and (iii) Anti-money laundering (AML) regime. The banking sector component will aim to reduce the cost of borrowing and expand access to credit by facilitating debt enforcement and lowering the cost of collateral registration. This component will also introduce legal and regulatory changes to strengthen corporate governance in banks and to improve the supervision of groups and conglomerates that control financial institutions. The NBF sector component will seek to enhance the sector's role in resource mobilization and allocation by developing the legal and regulatory framework, strenghening regulatory capacity through the establishment of a single regulator for NBF sector, the Nonbank Financial Regulatory Commission (NBFRC), and strengthening corporate governance and transparency. This component will also aim to reduce the distortionary impact of tax policies on the financial sector. The AML component will seek to mitigate the potential risks from money laundering activities by supporting the development of the legal and regulatory framework for the AML regime, and the establishment of a financial intelligence unit to monitor and report suspicious financial transactions.",4.0,2006-07-04,2010-06-30,2006-07-04,2010-06-30,Ministry of Finance,LN2218,Multilateral,40.0,Asian Development Bank,LN2218,Multilateral,40.0,,,,,Ministry of Finance,LN2218,Multilateral,40.0,MN,Mongolia,,,,,24010,Financial policy and administrative management,,,1,2.0,411.0,10.0,A01,5.0,,USD,10000000.0,5150329.03,0,0,700611.65,1833467.38,0

The International Organization for Migration (IOM), since 2007, has been operating in Ethiopia assisting migrants and internally displaced persons (IDPs) to save and restore their lives. This project, launched in April 2017, aims to save lives and contribute to the protection of IDPs in Ethiopia through: 1) enhancing information management on disaster and displacement, 2) providing life-saving and protective emergency shelter (ES) and non-food items (NFI) to displaced persons through both in-kind and cash-based &amp; voucher assistance, 3) establishing/strengthening referral mechanisms through coordinated effort with Protection Cluster and CP/GBV sub-cluster to ensure protection needs of most vulnerable IDPs, 4) supporting the most vulnerable migrant returnees from KSA forced deportation, 5) ES/NFI ALERT funding for newly displaced flood-affected populations, and 6) Site Management Support (SMS) and life-saving Water, Sanitation &amp; Hygiene (WASH) interventions to support Gedeo and West Guji internally displaced persons. The ALERT funding announced in May 2018, incorporated as Result 4, addresses the immediate life-saving ES/NFI needs of 10,000 HH beneficiaries (55,000 individuals) in the context of recent widespread flooding. The current displacement in Gedeo and West Guji is occurring in the context of a large humanitarian caseload of existing IDPs in Ethiopia. IOM's Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) Round 10 conducted in March/April 2018, identified 1,613,436 internally displaced persons of which, 1,073,764 are displaced due to conflict and 488,090 due to climate induced displacement (Annex 1).

ProCap, GenCap och UNDAC)","Detta beslut är ett kompletterande insatsbeslut till avtal med OCHA om bidrag till humanitära insatser, och gäller år 2017. Beslutet tas i enlighet med Sidas insatshanteringsregel paragraf 3.11.3. och avser det fjärde året av Sidas avtal med OCHA för stöd till humanitär fältsamordning (2014-2017). Avtalsperioden förlängdes i januari 2016 till 30 oktober 2018 i syfte att säkerställa att det sammanfaller med OCHA:s strategi (Strategic Framework) för 2014 - 2017.

Sida har redan i 2016 beslutat och avtalat om SEK 96 000 000 för 2017. Genom detta beslut görs ett tillägg på SEK 4 000 000, vilket innebär en sammalagd finansiering på SEK 100 000 000 för 2017. Även fördelningen av stödet mella land- och regionkontor samt tekniska program görs genom detta kompletterande insatsbeslut och bilagt avtalstillägg. 

Sida bedömer att samtliga medel för 2017 ska utbetalas omgående för att möjliggöra planering och uppstart av årets verksamhet. Ett avsteg från Sidas vanliga rutiner om uppdelade betalningar bedöms motiverat.

Bedömningspromemorian har skrivits på engelska med anledning av att engelskspråkig personal i fält är delaktig i beredning och uppföljning av insatsen, i enlighet med generaldirektörens beslut om Sidas språkvalsmatris med tillämpningsanvisningar från den 1 mars 2013. 

-------------

År 2017 beräknas över 100 miljoner människor vara i behov av humanitärt stöd. För att säkerställa ett snabbt, effektivt och behovsbaserat stöd krävs en stark humanitär samordningsmekanism som påvisar effektivitet även i de svåraste miljöer. UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) har enligt generalförsamlingens resolution 46/182 detta mandat och har visat i stor utsträckning kunna leverera denna samordningsuppgift genom sina kontor i 50 länder, 9 regional kontor och högkvarter (i Geneve och New York). 

På landnivå är OCHA:s mandat att a) samordna behovsbedömningsprocessen i varje land så att en enhetlig behovsanalys produceras, b) samordna den humanitära responsen i varje land. OCHA ansvarar för att säkra samordning mellan sektorer, hantera information, stödja en samlad uppföljning av responsen, resursmobilisering, och stödja den humanitära samordnaren (HC) i sitt arbete. OCHA har även ett specifikt ansvar att säkra integrering av övergripande frågor såsom gender och skyddsfrågor, vilket görs bl.a. genom de OCHA-administrerade GenCap och ProCap -programmen. 

Huvudsyftet med insatsen är att stödja OCHA i sitt uppdrag att implementera sitt samordningsmandat stipulerat i Resolution 46/182. Detta mandat konkretiseras vidare genom ""OCHA Plan and Budget 2016"". Huvudsyftet med stödet är att stödja Mål 1 ""Field Effectivenes"", med följande delmål: 
1.	Stärkt humanitärt ledarskap
2.	Harmonisering och koordinering av behovsbedömningar
3.	Gemensam humanitär responsplanering, implementering och uppföljning 
4.	Flxibel och anpassningsbara koordineringsstrukturer
5. Skydd för och tillträde till drabbade befolkning 

År 2017 tilldelas OCHA:s landkontor, regionala kontor samt tekniska program sammanlagt 100 MSK (varav detta beslut avser 4 MSK) med följande fördelning: 

För lankontor sammanlagt 78 MSEK: Afghanistan 3,5 MSEK, CAR 4 MSEK, DRK 7 MSEK, Irak 3 MSEK, Mali 4 MSEK, Niger 4 MSEK, Tchad 4 MSEK, Kamerun 4 MSEK, Palestina 2 MSEK, Somalia 4 MSEK, Sydsudan 5 MSEK, Sudan 2 MSEK, Jemen 5 MSEK, Colombia 1 MSEK, Etiopien 2 MSEK, Myanmar 2 MSEK, Pakistan 2 MSEK, Syrienkrisen (inkl. kontoren Syrien, Turkiet, Jordanien, Libanon) 10 MSEK, Philippines 1 MSEK, Ukraina 1,5 MSEK, Haiti 1 MSEK, Nigeria 4 MSEK, Libyen 1 MSEK, Burundi 1 MSEK.

För regionala kontor sammalagt 13 MSEK: Västra Afrika 4 MSK, Östra Afrika 2 MSK, Mellanöstern och Norra Afrika 2 MSK, Asien 4 MSK, Stilla havet 1 MSEK. 

För tekniska program sammanlagt 9 MSEK: GenCap 4 MSK, ProCap 3 MSK, and UNDAC 2 MSK.

Ovan fördelning sker på basis av Sidas behovsbaserade humanitära allokeringsmodell.

Increasing production depends on smallholder enterprises, located in densely populated rural areas, boosting reproductive rates of cows and improving management techniques to accelerate the fattening of animals so that they can be sold at market sooner. To achieve these objectives changes to traditional feeds of rice straw combined with small amounts of crop residues and supplements are needed.

Many of the families in the area are former internally displaced people who fled to the cities of Gori and Tbilisi at the height of the conflict. Since returning, many families found much of the livestock in the village was killed or stolen, and many of the houses were burned. There is a shortage of fodder and most of the areas orchards were destroyed. Due to the threat of active landmines, crops cannot be harvested. It will take several seasons to restore agriculture production. Livestock and dairy production is one of the few jobs that offers returning farmers the chance for economic and social security. By becoming involved in dairy production, participants will gain access to much-needed nutrients and pursue opportunities to earn money. Farmers will also re-enter the market through production and sale of cheese and other milk products. In the first year of the project, Heifer International will provide at least 150 families with 150 local breed Caucasian brown breed heifers. An additional 150 families will benefit from passing on the gift in the third year of the project. An additional 25 families in the community will benefit from participating in project trainings.

The project supports indigenous peoples? organisations or other CSOs working with local communities in five countries (Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Nepal and Tanzania) in implementing a participatory assessment on the resilience of indigenou
s peoples? and local communities? biocultural approaches and biodiversity conservation as well as restoration initiatives. In addition, capacity-building events will be organised on the participatory assessment methodology developed by the CCRI. The Uganda
n NAPE will provide technical support to the actors implementing the assessments, and organise meetings for the new leaders of the communities, which have participated in the CCRI previously in order to support them in implementing the agreed recommendatio
ns. The preliminary findings of the at least 15 assessments to be implemented will be documented in five national reports. An advocacy campaign will be implemented during the UN Biodiversity convention?s Conference of the Parties in December 2016 in Mexico
 in order to disseminate the CCRI findings. The main findings of the assessments will also be disseminated within the involved communities and to the broader public through for instance social media, leaflets and radio programmes. The project aims at promo
ting more effective and appropriate forms of legal, political, technical, financial and other support that can address the most important internal and external threats to the resilience of community conservation. There is increasing scientific and politica
l acknowledgement of the significance of indigenous peoples? and local communities? conservation and restoration initiatives to the protection of biodiversity and climate change mitigation as well as resilience. The initiatives face, however, both external
 and internal threats, and there is lack of sufficient analysis on the support needed by the communities. Resilience assessments carried out by the communities enable presenting their own alternatives to strengthening the resilience. Project beneficiaries 
include indigenous peoples and local communities implementing collective biodiversity protection and restoration initiatives. During the project 100 community representatives trained on the participatory assessment methodology are expected to reach 7 500 p
eople in 15 communities, in which the assessments will be implemented. Gender equality and women?s participation will be paid particular attention to during the assessment processes.

I Sahel-området i det nordlige Afrika er 80 pct. af al dyrkbar landbrugsjord påvirket af ørkenspredning. Det skaber massive fattigdomsproblemer for de mennesker, der bor i de berørte områder. Jorden kan ikke længere bruges til landbrug, og millioner mister deres livsgrundlag. Specielt i landene Niger, Chad, Sudan, Burkina Faso og Mali melder både UNICEF og WFP om stigende fødevareusikkerhed på grund af tørke og høje fødevarepriser. I Mauretanien vurderer WFP, at omkring 700.000 mennesker er ramt af alvorlig fødevaremangel, sammenlignet med 500.000 i de foregående år. Uregelmæssigheder i regnmængden, særligt i det østlige Sahel, har resulteret i store tab i høstudbytte og enorme græsningsarealer, der ligger afsvedne hen. 
Med bidraget til UNICEF bidrages der til at øge modstandskraften hos lokalbefolkningerne på tværs af Sahelbæltet og på at forberede sig strategisk på dårlig høst med fejlernæring og sult til følge i 2012.

Esta iniciativa consiste en iniciar y acompañar procesos que realice alumnado de 4º de la ESO y 1º de Bachillerato. A través de 3 talleres dinámicos de sensibilización en las aulas, acerca de las desigualdades sociales existentes en nuestro entorno y en países del Sur, y presentando la solidaridad como eje de alternativascomo el decrecimiento o el comercio justo, se reta a los y las jóvenes que quieran participar, a pensar y realizar actividades solidarias en beneficio de personas y grupos más desfavorecidos, apoyando iniciativas de la ciudad de Pamplona en torno a diversos Días Internacionales. Esto les motiva y pone en marcha sus capacidades personales en torno a una causa común, poniendo en juego lo que ellos y ellas saben y pueden hacer; sus riquezas personales. Las actividades tendrán un componente solidario y de denuncia. Y el objetivo final está centrando en la necesidad de crear soberanía popular, que la ciudadanía tenga conciencia de la necesidad de su implicación y participación social para poder alcanzar ese otro mundo posible. El mayor valor del proyecto no son las actividades en sí mismas, sino el proceso experiencial de desarrollo de valores, habilidades y actitudes que realizan los y las jóvenes: solidaridad, participación, protagonismo, emprendiduría, diálogo, equidad de género, responsabilidad, esfuerzo, creatividad, alegría, asertividad, autoestima, sociabilidad, interculturalidad, conciencia crítica, justicia, democracia, no-violencia, etc. Hemos seleccionado a la juventud como destinataria teniendo en cuenta uno de los principios de Fundación Adsis: ?trabajo con y para los y las jóvenes?. De hecho, la educación en valores de los y las jóvenes y su formación como personas en la sociedad es un tema que preocupa tanto a los centros educativos como a las instituciones y sociedad en general. Fundación Adsis cuenta con una amplia experiencia en la puesta en marcha de proyectos de Sensibilización y Educación para el Desarrollo en centros educativos de todo el estado.En Navarra llevamos trabajando en diversos centros educativos desde el año 2010, y con este proyecto queremos consolidar las relaciones establecidas hasta el momento así como iniciar relaciones nuevas con otros centros. Debemos decir que este proyecto se ha llevado a cabo en Barcelona con financiación de su ayuntamiento y se han obtenido unos resultados muy positivos, tanto es así, que el proyecto se ha publicado en la Guía de Buenas Prácticas del Ayuntamiento de Barcelona.""",3,2013-10-17,2014-08-31,,,EELL NAV - Navarra,AC-53,,,Spain,,Government,10,EELL NAV AYTO PAMPLONA/IRUÑA,AC2-367,,,Fundación ADSIS,AC-247,,,,,,998.0,"Developing countries, unspecified",,99820,Promotion of development awareness,,,1,1.0,,10.0,H01,,,EUR,3794.0,3794.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0

The
project is designed to contribute to the achievement of the long-term goal of
the health and nutrition recovery strategy for Darfur; Progressively
restructure the health and nutrition arena, now a patchwork of disparate
elements that emerged in response to multiple stressors, into a coherent,
effective, efficient and equitable service delivery system. The identified gaps and deficiencies are significant
and addressing them constitutes a giant endeavor. Taking into account the limiting factors such as poor
implementation capacity fo the stkeholders, and hostile environment (insecurity and unpredictable
instability), a sequenced/three-pronged health nutrition recovery strategy for
Darfur has been endorsed by the MOH and DRA.



The
project is in line with many measures included into the first
prong health recovery strategy. Maximizing the outputs of existing health and
nutrition services by filling gaps, upgrading assets, expanding services,
boosting productivity, and improving quality of health services is the overall
objective of proposed project. And thus meeting the basic human rights of the community. 



The
focus will be on infrastructure rehabilitation, as well as functional upgrading
of health facilities with the heaviest workload and closer to vulnerable,
conflict affected population settlements. 

The selected site is the one where the needs are the
highest, the implementation will positively impact on the largest number of
vulnerable people, there is safe access to enable the implementation,
supervision and monitoring, and they are included into the Darfur health
recovery plan (Government commitment). The planned interventions for the
achievement of the project goal include: 1. Quality health services and facilities accessed by
approximately 25,000 people in the Northern Darfur State, specifically Kutum Locality.2.Basic maternal and child health care services
enhanced in Northern Darfur state through training midwives to reduce maternal
and infant mortality and improve postnatal care ",2,2015-04-20,2019-03-11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,Sudan,,589,"Middle East, regional",,16050,Multisector aid for basic social services,,OECD Development Assistance Committee,DAC,1.0,110.0,20.0,CO1,CO1,USD,,0.0,0.0,369460.0,370000.0,0.0,0.0,0

It has emerged as one of the world's largest democracies. Its economy is growing. It is also an important regional power in Asia.

However, considerable weaknesses in its state institutions persist, restricting the country's ability to generate inclusive economic growth and political stability. Many state institutions, such as the judiciary, police force, public administration, and diplomatic corps, remain critically understaffed. They struggle to provide public services, and governance weaknesses are hampering them. 

This project will help improve our understanding of how Indian state institutions can function more effectively to support inclusive economic growth and political stability. Researchers will examine capacity gaps in key Indian state institutions. They will propose ways to strengthen human capital and institutional performance. The project team will work closely with Indian think tanks and senior government officials to ensure the findings are relevant.

More specifically, the project will support a three-day author's workshop to:
- bring together researchers to develop a multi-year research framework focusing on India's core state institutions; and,
- support the development of new papers on the capacity of India's state institutions. 

The chapters will be included in an updated and expanded edition of the book, Public Institutions in India: Performance and Design (Oxford University Press).",4.0,,,2013-04-15,2014-11-30,University of Pennsylvania Institute for the Advanced Study of India,,National NGO,22.0,Canada.

Afrikanska Unionen är det enda organ som har ett politiskt mandat att på pan-Afrikansk nivå trycka på för förbättringar genom att arbeta för alla medlemsländer och regionala ekonomiska gemenskaper.
 
Avdelningen för handel och industri (DTI) vid Afrikanska Unionens Kommission (AUC) har mandat att bidra till att hela Afrika integreras till ett enda handelsblock och blir en stor och konkurrenskrafting handelspartner i den globala ekonomin genom tätt samarbete med medlemsstaterna, de regionala ekonomiska gemenskaperna och andra intressenter. Medlemsstaterna och de regionala ekonomiska gemenskaperna har arbetat, och arbetar fortfarande, med skapande och utformandet av de regionala ekonomiska gemenskaperna för att fördjupa samarbetet och harmoniseringen inom varje regional ekonomisk gemenskap (dvs aktiviteterna inom varje regional ekonomisk gemenskap som omnämns i Abuja-avtalet). Tiden är emellertid inne för att öka ansträngningarna på pan-Afrikansk nivå (dvs mellan de regionala ekonomiska gemenskaperna ) att uppnå en bredare och mer harmoniserad ekonomisk integration på kontinenten. Med sitt Pan-Afrikanska mandat och sin räckvidd är AU den mest lämpade aktören att ta den regionala integrationen ett steg vidare (dvs mot ett Pan-Afrikanst frihandelsområdet, tullunion och slutligen monetär union), framförallt genom koordinering och harmonisering av handelsregler och procedures (tullar och icke-tariffära handelshinder) mellan de regionala ekonomiska gemenskaperna. 

I den Afrikanska Unionens nuvarande Strategiska plan (2014  2017) ska arbetet inom handel och industri fokusera på att både öka handeln inom Afrika och Afrikas andel av den globala handeln, bl.a. genom att etablera (underlätta förhandlingar för att uppnå) ett kontinent-övergripande frihandelsavtal för bredare och djupare regional integration på kontinenten, vilket bl.a. innebär ökad harmonizering av handelspolitik och lagar, förbättrad implementering av Handelsproceduravtalet som framförhandlats under Världshandelsorganisationen (WTO). Målet är att det ska leda till förenklade handelsprocedurer mellan medlemsstaterna, ökad produktiv kapacitet och bättre infrastuktur samt uthålligt utnyttjande av kontinentens naturresurser.

I linje med AUCs strategiska plan (ovan) kommer Sveriges stöd till AUC DTI 2015 att fokusera på ett speciellt projekt som heter ""Stöd till genomförandet av WTOs handelsproceduravtal"" vilket i sin tur innebär stöd till genomförandet av en ""gap och behovsanalys"" och därefter utformning av en strategi för hela Afrikanska Unionen rörande genomförandet av WTOs handelsproceduravtal på kontinenten. 

Det föreslagna stödet är mycket relevant i förhållande till både Afrikanska unionens och Sveriges strategiska prioriteringar samt de slutgiltiga mottagarna, dvs AU:s medlemsstater och regionala ekonomiska gemenskaper. Dessutom kompletterar det föreslagna stödet det stöd som andra givare ger.",4,,,2015-03-01,2018-09-28,AFRICAN UNION COMMISSION,,,,Sweden,SE-0,Government,10,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency,SE-6,Government,10,African Union (excluding peacekeeping facilities),47005.0,Multilateral,40.0,,,,298.0,"Africa, regional",100.0,33110,Trade policy and administrative management,100,,1,1.0,110.0,10.0,B03,5.0,USD,,177950.719514,177950.719514,0.0,0,0.0,0,0

Die Maßnahme soll das indische Poljoimpfprogramm im Rahmen der globalen Bemühungen zur Poliobekämpfung unterstützen, die Übertragung und Zirkulation des wilden Poliovirus zu unterbrechen, damit das Land in absehbarer Zeit von der WHO als poliofrei zertifiziert werden kann. Zwischenzeitlich konnte die WHO diese Zertifizierung ausstellen. Ziel der Maßnahme ist; - die landesweite Impfung aller Kinder unter 5 Jahren mit einem oralen Polioimpfstoff sowie - die erfolgreiche Umsetzung eines landesweiten Polioüberwachungssystems zur Erfassung aller Fälle von akuter schlaffer Lähmung (Acute Flaccid Paralysis, AFP- Surveillance), um die Voraussetzung für einen schnellen Einsatz von Nachimpfkampagnen in Gebieten mit potentiellen Neufällen zu schaffen. Die Unterstützung beinhaltet insbesondere die Beschaffung der benötigten Impfstoffe für die jährlich mehrfach durchgeführten nationalen sowie subnationalen Impfkampagnen in 2008/09 (EUR 44,58 Mio.) sowie, in geringem Umfang, die Beschaffung von Laborausrüstung und Verbrauchsgüter für den Aufbau des Polioüberwachungssystems (EUR 0,50 Mio.). Programmträger ist das indische Gesundheitsministerium. Die Beschaffungen erfolgen jedoch über UNICEF (Impfstoffe) und WHO (Laborausrüstung). Die FZ-Maßnahme Ist abgeschlossen. Die Gesamtkosten des indischen Polioimpfprogramms für den Zeitraum 2008/09 betrugen geschätzte EUR 442,49 Mio. statt wie ursprünglich geplant EUR 443,00 Mio. Die bereitgestellte Finanzierung aus der Poliolinie XI (FZ-Darlehen) in Höhe von EUR 13,58 Mio. konnte vollständig umgesetzt werden. Die Zuschussmittel der Linie XI wurden vollständig gekürzt (siehe Datenblatt 2008 10 048).

The region includes Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and China's Yunnan Province. This integration is in line with market-oriented reforms in China, moves toward establishing an ASEAN economic community, and trend toward greater regional economic integration, including the China-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement. 

One of the key consequences of this trend has been the significant growth of foreign direct investment from China in the region, particularly in the low-income countries of Laos, Cambodia, and Burma. Chinese investment has grown rapidly for the following reasons: 
-China's proximity to the region; 
-increased ease of cross-border trade, investment capital, and people flows; and,
-attractive regulatory and policy environment. 

Investment from China has generally involved production of low-tech, labour intensive, and land intensive products which have directly and indirectly affected the course of economic development, industrial structure, and local labour market and enterprise development.

This research project looks at the impacts of Chinese investment on local economies and on local enterprise development in Laos and Cambodia. Both countries have challenges managing, promoting, and maximizing the benefits of foreign direct investment, especially in terms of employment and building local economic activity. However, there are few studies examining the impacts of foreign investment on local enterprises in the region, and of the positive and negative spillover effects.

China's size and the nature of these interventions, policies, and incentives make its investments particularly interesting from a policy perspective. The project will broaden understanding of the impact of Chinese investment at the industrial structure and local enterprise levels. It will review existing policies and regulations within each of the countries, assess the impact of Chinese investment on industrial structure, examine spillover effects on local enterprises, and provide policy recommendations to maximize benefits and mitigate negative impacts.

Researchers from the School of Economics and Management at Kunming University of Science and Technology will collaborate with researchers at the Faculty of Economics and Business Management at the National University of Laos, and the Cambodia Economics Association. The project will help increase researchers' capacity to conduct economic analysis and apply research methods. Activities will include short courses for emerging young researchers, mentorship, technical advisory support, and collaborative research.",2.0,,2017-01-23,2014-01-23,,Kunming University of Science and Technology as represented by Zhang Yingjie,,Foundation,60.0,Canada.

Den startade som en lös sammanslutning mellan 14 människorättsorganisationer 2010 och registrerades formellt 2012. Under den första perioden fanns nätverket under en av Sidas långsiktiga partner och den mest framträdande tanzaniska människorättsorganisationen, Legal and Human Rights Center, LHRC. Närverket har vuxit i betydelse under åren och består för närvarande av 130 medlemsorganisationer. THRDC är nu en stark aktör för människorättsförsvarare och har kunnat bygga upp kontakter med centrala nationella myndigheter som kommissionen för mänskliga rättigheter och god samhällsstyrning, CHRAGG, registret för icke-statliga organisationer, polisväsendet och lagstiftande församling.

Huvudmålet med THRDC är att förbättra säkerheten och skyddet av människorättsförsvarare i Tanzania och skapa en säkrare arbetsmiljö för dessa. Organisationen avser också att stärka regionala och internationella insatser för skydd och främjande av människorättsförsvarare. Den tidigare strategiska planen 2013-2017 har löpt ut och en ny strategi för 2018-2022 har tagits fram. Organisationens verksamhet bygger kring följande mål:
- Att bygga upp kapacitet hos människorättsförsvarare i säkerhets- och skyddshantering.
- Att förbättra säkerheten och skyddet människorättsförsvarare i Tanzania.
- Att arbeta för erkännande av människorättsförsvarare och det arbete som de gör i Tanzania.",2,,,2018-06-01,2021-06-28,THRDC/TANZANIA HUMAN RIGHTS DE,,,,Sweden,SE-0,Government,10,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency,SE-6,Government,10,Other,90000.0,,90.0,TZ,"Tanzania, United Republic Of",100.0,,,,15160,,100,,1,1.0,110.0,10.0,C01,5.0,USD,,57534.750989,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0

We Effect har inkommit med en ansökan om rambidrag för 2017 på sammanlagt SEK 188 033 400 för en ettårig förlängning av det program som genomförs under ramanslaget 2014-2016. Sida har därför beslutat att bereda insatsen som ett kompletterande insatsbeslut. Sida bedömer att ansökan är relevant under den nya strategin för stöd genom Svenska organisationer i det civila samhället (CSO-strategin) 2016-2022 och beslutar om ett bidrag om 180 000 000 SEK. Denna beredning har genomförts i samarbete mellan handläggare Eva-Lotta Gustafsson och USAID:s sekondering till Sida Joshua Haynes.

Ansökande organisation: 

We Effect är en ideell, partipolitiskt och religiöst obunden organisation vars syfte är att stärka medlemsbaserade och demokratiska organisationers förmåga att göra det möjligt för fattiga kvinnor och män att förbättra sina levnadsvillkor, försvara sina rättigheter och bidra till ett rättvist samhälle. We Effect bildades 1958 och har varit ramorganisation sedan 1978 under namnet Kooperation Utan Gränser. Organisationen är en demokratiskt strukturerad förening och bakom We Effect står ett sextiotal medlemsorganisationer från den svenska konsument- och producentkooperationen. We Effect är en väletablerad organisation i det svenska samhället, med ett öppet och demokratiskt arbetssätt - och med en stark internationell förankring.

We Effects vision är en hållbar och rättvis värld fri från fattigdom och organisationen arbetar inom landsbygdsutveckling och bostäder, inkluderat rätten till mark, jämställdhet och finansiella tjänster. Ansökan omfattar 17 program på regional eller landnivå och ett globalt program som totalt består av 160 projekt i 24 länder. 

Sida beslutade 2014 att förnya We Effects status som ramorganisation. 

Ansökan:

Ansökan bygger på We Effects prioriteringar och följer logiskt på tidigare verksamhet. We Effects ramansökan för 2017 är en fortsättning på det ramprogram som genomförs under pågående ramavtal 2014-2016.

Syftet med stödet är att stärka partnerorganisationen som sådan och att detta i sin tur ökar organisationens förmåga att å ena sidan påverka och kräva förändring på makronivå/strukturell nivå och, å andra sidan erbjuda medlemmarna efterfrågade tjänster. Enligt We Effects förändringsteori genomförs den huvudsakliga verksamheten av partnerorganisationerna. Inom programmen för landsbygdsutveckling stödjer We Effect bondeorganisationer i deras arbete med att öka sina medlemmars inkomster och tillgång till mat genom t.ex. jordbruksrådgivning, stärkt position på marknaden och hjälp med förhandlingar om priser. Organisationen förespråkar ett hållbart och klimatanpassat jordbruk och stödjer också lokala spar- och kreditföreningar som gör det möjligt för lantbrukare med små resurser att spara och låna pengar samt få tillgång till försäkringar. Inom bostadsprogrammen arbetar We Effect med lokala bostadskooperativ där medlemmarna tillsammans bygger sina bostäder. Kooperativen bedriver påverkansarbete för tillgång till bostadskrediter och säkrad rätt till mark att bygga på. Jämställdhet är ett prioriterat område för We Effects verksamhet. We Effect strävar efter att integrera jämställdhet i all verksamhet och organisationen stödjer partnerorganisationernas arbete med att stärka kvinnors rättigheter, bland annat genom kvinnligt ledarskap, en mer rättvis arbetsfördelning i jordbruket samt genom att försvara kvinnors rätt till mark. 

Målgruppen för We Effects utvecklingssamarbete är kvinnor och män som lever i fattigdom och som är medlemmar, eller potentiella medlemmar, i kooperativa organisationer, andra demokratiska föreningar eller informella grupper vilka arbetar för att uppnå gemensamma mål.

Förväntade resultat:

We Effects ansökan har resultatmatriser på land- och regional nivå, med indikatorer och utgångsvärden. På global nivå finns en resultatmatris men utan aggregerade utgångs- och målvärden. Ansökan har följande mål:

The project inherits a rich store of expertise and resources from predecessor projects going back nearly 40 years.

K4Health meets the knowledge needs of health program managers and health service providers, both directly and via capacity strengthening of institutions and organizations. K4Health strategically connects people, institutions, ideas, and technical information, focusing on creating and continually improving platforms, products, and services that support knowledgeable program managers and service providers. This is accomplished through capture and synthesis of evidence as well as other knowledge management techniques such as knowledge generation, curation, and dissemination.

Svk vill bidra till att stärka människor som aktiva deltagare i kyrkorna och som rättighetsbärare och medborgare i samhället och verka aktivt för stärkandet av det civila samhället genom kapacitetsstärkande åtgärder för att samarbetspartners i ännu större utsträckning kan bli dynamiska civilsamhällesaktörer som förändrar kyrkor och samhällen i en positiv riktning.  Svks internationella arbete bedrivs inom ramen för sammanlagt sex tematiska områden och varje tematiskt område har ett eller två övergripande strategiska mål som specificerar de förändringar som SvK vill bidra till att uppnå. De sex tematiska områdena är: 1. Teologi och utveckling, 2. Rättvis fred, 3. Genusrättvisa och jämställdhet, 4. Sexuell och reproduktiv hälsa och rättigheter, 5. Rättvis och hållbar försörjning samt 6. Rädda liv, lindra nöd och upprätthålla mänsklig värdighet. Den sistnämnda är inom CSO-anslaget enbart aktuell för pilotprogrammen för resiliens.  Svks projekt genomförs under perioden 2018-2022 i land/regionprogram samt i ett globalt påverkansprogram (GPD). Svk deltar aktivt i policydialog och opinionsbildning gentemot beslutsfattare för att bidra till en utvecklingspolitik som utgår från perspektiven och rättigheterna hos människor som är nedtystade eller lever i utsatta situationer. Svks utvecklingssamarbete utgår från ovan nämnda sex övergripande tematiska områden med tillhörande nio strategiska mål (SG). För att uppnå dessa mål samverkar Svk i policy-dialog med lokala kyrkor, ekumeniska nätverk, SRHR-nätverk, hiv-positivas nätverk, media, beslutsfattare (regeringar och parlament), och interstatliga organisationer som FN och EU, ett arbetssätt som stärker civilsamhällenas roll och gynnar samhällsklimatet för CSO i utvecklingsländer.  Svk arbetar genomgående med ett rättighetsperspektiv till förmån för särskilt utsatta grupper i utvecklingsländer/kontext, med särskilt fokus på kvinnor, barn, ungdomar, ursprungsbefolkningar, flyktingar, internflyktingar samt migranter, och verkar även för en dialog över religiösa gränser, särskilt i fredsfrämjande syften i länder som präglas av konflikt och/eller post-konflikt. Således bidrar Svk till att stärka en mångfald inom civilsamhället.",2,,,2018-01-01,2023-10-28,,,,,Sweden,SE-0,Government,10,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency,SE-6,Government,10,,,,,SS,South Sudan,100.0,,,,15150,Democratic participation and civil society,100,,1,1.0,110.0,10.0,B03,5.0,USD,,224960.876369,224960.876369,0.0,0,0.0,0,0

At the Kabul and Lisbon Conferences in 2010, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Afghan government agreed that full responsibility for security would be handed over by 2014. The country now faces the prospect of a drawdown of most international military forces that so far have supported the fight against the ongoing insurgency. At the same time, Afghanistan is gearing up for a presidential election in April 2014 which many anticipate to be a difficult process given the complex political environment and challenging logistics. Despite these steps, Afghanistan will need to rely heavily on donor financing to ensure the continued provision of public services and investment through the transition period. At the request of the authorities, this Development Policy Grant (DPG) series is designed to support the government's strategy for developing greater economic and fiscal self-reliance. The reform program is ambitious, especially in light of the upcoming elections, but it is strongly supported by the government, key stakeholders and donors. This program document describes the first in a series of two programmatic grants to Afghanistan. The first operation is in the amount of US$50 million, out of US$100 million for the programmatic series. A programmatic approach is proposed to carry on reform momentum and strengthen reform incentives during times in which political incentives for reforms are typically low due to upcoming election. Moreover, lessons from other operations in Afghanistan favor a carefully sequenced and continuous reform-approach.",3,2010-10-29,2015-06-15,2013-08-07,2015-06-15,MINISTRY OF FINANCE,,,,International Development Association,44002,Multilateral,40,International Development Association,44002.0,Multilateral,40,MINISTRY OF FINANCE,,,,AF,Afghanistan,100,,,,15111;22020;32210;43040;23040;21020;CI;BC;LZ;AZ;000212;000122;000011;000432;000411;000072;000114;000043;000112;000211;000123;000121;000041;000111;000725;000012;000021,Public finance management;Telecommunications;Mineral/mining policy and administrative management;Rural development;Electrical transmission/ distribution;Road transport;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,32;32;14;14;4;4;33;34;19;14;25;3;9;10;10;20;3;10;3;15;3;3;10;3;20;9;40,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,1;1;1;1;1;1;99;99;99;99;98;98;98;98;98;98;98;98;98;98;98;98;98;98;98;98;98,2.0,,,A02,5,USD,,50000000.0,51197751.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

This project is designed as #learn as you practice#, combining training and support through a learning platform in partnership with Young in Prison (YIP), an international network of knowledge. In Kenya, YADEN will pull together other national initiatives and networks (that include government and non-government partnerships) and their own East Africa programme (Uganda and Tanzania) and grassroots. This will provide a diverse and rich learning experience.

Este objetivo se justifica por cuanto descrito en el punto 2.b. De manera más específica, se pretende, en primer lugar, una mejora de los procedimientos de comunicación entre el departamento técnico y el departamento administrativo-financiero para ajustar las propuestas de proyectos para que sean acordes a los fines fundacionales y a las políticas de la organización. Para ello se redactará un manual/guía, sujeto a los fines de la organización, para la selección de proyectos y su evaluación y se describirá el circuito de aprobación del proyecto con el fin de garantizar el cumplimiento de las políticas de la organización en cuanto a implicación de recursos internos, financiación del proyecto, disponibilidad temporal y de recursos para acometerlos con garantías de éxito con el nivel de calidad autoexigido. En segundo lugar, se pretende aumentar a un nivel de excelencia el seguimiento de los proyectos, a lo largo de todo su proceso de desarrollo hasta el cierre presupuestario y justificación de los mismos. La optimización en el seguimiento, tiene como objetivo secundario, a no menospreciar, la reducción de los desvíos presupuestarios. Para todo ello, es imprescindible proceder a una optimización de los métodos de seguimiento y control de los socios locales durante la gestión del proyecto por parte de los responsables técnicos de la organización. Por estas razones, la intervención prevé la organización de cursos sensibilización y formación de técnicos en el área de control financiero y administrativo, así como sobre las pautas a seguir para la mejora sustancial del control interno de los proyectos y el aseguramiento de su implantación. En este marco se prevé la elaboración de un Manual de Control Interno de calidad de gestión de los proyectos, que incluirá documentos de: seguimiento presupuestario y de ejecución temporal de los proyectos para uso de los técnicos; de evaluación de desarrollo de los proyectos individuales en términos de flujos financieros y de calendario de ejecución; de evaluación del desarrollo general de proyectos entre ejercicios en términos de flujos financieros y de calendario de ejecución. Objetivo secundario de este proceso de formación es que dichos técnicos sean capaces de actuar como formadores de los técnicos de los socios locales para conseguir su compromiso en el cumplimiento del presupuesto y cronograma de los proyectos.""",3.0,2011-06-01,2011-10-08,,,MAEC - Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores y de Cooperación,AC-1,,,Spain,,Government,10.0,AECID - Agencia Española de Cooperación Internacional al Desarrollo,AC2-1,,,Otra ONG nacional - país donante,AC-181,,,,,,998,"Developing countries, unspecified",,99810,Sectors not specified,,,1,3.0,,10.0,B01,5.0,,EUR,45360,45360,0,0,0.0,0.0,0

Local governments are working to offer the right environments to create more dynamic domestic private sectors. Growth can exclude some groups and individuals, so governments have turned to public-private partnerships to promote equitable and sustainable growth. 

There are challenges. Empirical evidence about how well public-private partnerships work is only available for a few types of initiatives-typically infrastructure or pharmaceutical research. For example, there is limited evidence on successful partnerships between the public and private sector in agriculture, climate change, or public health. The available evidence suggests that partnerships with small and medium domestic enterprises make better targets to improve development indicators such as nutritional status, food security, or household income. 

This is a new area of research. This project will enable researchers to identify key issues and research capacity in agriculture and environment. The research team will conduct scoping studies to identify a pool of researchers and institutions to conduct innovative and substantive work in this area. IDRC will also solicit research proposals using a closed call. This initiative will fund projects that will provide practical guidance and direction to the public sector to help identify ways to partner with others in the private sector in order to promote local economic development. The goal is to scale up results from successful research, pilot studies, or programs.

More specifically, this project will help:
- identify key research community players from the private or public sector who can conduct innovative research on public-private partnerships;
- develop projects that focus on how public-private partnerships with small and medium enterprises in developing countries improve and increase development outcomes;
- define a set of indicators and methods to measure success; and,
- validate the research results with national and international stakeholders to help inform practices and policies for partnering with small and medium enterprises.",2.0,,2016-03-24,2015-03-24,,United Nations University,,Multilateral,40.0,Canada.

The additional financing in the amount of US$50 million, approved by the Board on July 27, 2010, aims at filling the financing gap in the parent project caused by unforeseen cost increases and scaling up the parent project to include additional works. Because of reasons outside of the borrower's control, the additional financing loan only became effective on February 17, 2012, 18 months after its approval by the Bank's Board. Thanks to the Borrower's proactive engagement, the additional financing loan has disbursed US$15.07 million (30 percent) in just one year since effectiveness.

About Instituto Desarrollo, Participación y Ciudadanía
ID seeks to contribute to knowledge and to influence public policy design in the area of economic and social development. Its research projects cover a wide number of topics, from agricultural economics and income distribution to education, governance, and decentralization. It receives its funding from the Think Tank Initiative (TTI).

Stronger independent policy research institutions
TTI is a multi-funder program dedicated to strengthening independent policy research institutions, or think tanks, in developing countries. The program aims to enhance their ability to provide sound research that informs and influences policy. 

This second TTI phase (2014-2019) will fund 43 institutions, helping them consolidate their role as credible development actors in their countries, and in some cases, regionally and internationally. For ID, this project will help enhance its research quality, organizational performance, and policy engagement.  

Better research, performance, and engagement
Through this support over the next 4.5 years, ID is expected to 
-reach higher research standards through a new internal peer-review system and more publications in international peer-reviewed journals
-become an attractive option for researchers to pursue long-term careers through staff incentives 
-be more visible and influential through active engagement with the media and policy stakeholders
-strengthen resource mobilization activities and enjoy greater long-term financial sustainability

This funding will help ID attain its vision of becoming a key player in policy development in Paraguay through rigorous research and sustainable operations.

PARP). Es ist Teil einer gemeinschaftlichen Finanzierung von nunmehr 11 bilateralen und drei multilateralen Gebern, die Budgethilfezusagen für 2013 gemacht haben. Mosambik erhält seit 2001 allgemeine Budgethilfe (seit 2004 von Deutschland). Die Finanzierung des deutschen Budgethilfebeitrags erfolgt auf der Grundlage der Einstiegskriterien für die Gewährung von Budgethilfe gemäß dem Budgethilfekonzept des BMZ und einer Analyse der treuhänderischen Risiken durch die KfW und wird auf der Basis vereinbarter Ziele direkt in den öffentlichen Haushalt eingestellt. Der Politikdialog beruht auf einer mit den beteiligten Gebern und der mosambikanischen Regierung (GoM) gemeinsam entwickelten Politikmatrix (Performance Assessment Framework, PAF - mit aus der PARP abgeleiteten Indikatoren. Die vom Programm unterstützte Qualität der Regierungsführung ist von besonderer Bedeutung für die Gewährung und Auszahlung des deutschen Budgethilfebeitrags. Der deutsche Finanzierungsbeitrag für die allgemeine Budgethilfe für das Fiskaljahr 2013 beläuft sich auf eine feste Tranche von EUR 5,0 Mio. Sie setzt die deutsche Beteiligung an der Finanzierung des Armutsbekämpfungsprogramms der mosambikanischen Regierung fort. Deutschland ist bereit; weitere bis zu EUR 15,0 Mio. an allgemeiner Budgethilfe für die Fiskaljahre 2013 und 2014 zu leisten. Als zusätzlicher Beitrag zum Reformkurs der mosambikanischen Regierung und zur Minderung treuhänderischer Risiken wird der Budgethilfebeitrag von einer deutschen Beteiligung am Programm zur Reform des öffentlichen Finanzwesens begleitet (Begleitmaßnahme). Hierfür sind Beiträge in Höhe von insgesamt EUR 8,0 Mio. in den Bereichen Eigeneinnahmen (Beitrag zur Korbfinanzierung der Einnahmenbehörde), externe Rechenschaftslegung (Beitrag zur Korbfinanzierung des Rechnungshofes) und für die Förderung der besseren Begleitung des Budgetprozesses durch das Parlament, die Zivilgesellschaft und die Medien Mosambiks vorgesehen.",3.0,,2015-04-24,2013-06-10,2016-05-31,KfW Bankengruppe (KfW),XM-DAC-5-2,,,Germany,DE-1,Government,10.0,Bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (BMZ),DE-1,Government,10.0,,,,,MZ,Mozambique,100,,,,51010,General budget support,100,,1,1.0,110.0,10.0,A01,3.0,EUR,,11000000.0,11000000.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

Meeting that objective can be challenging, given the complex interactions among stakeholders, researchers, and communicators. Evaluation and communication are essential to ensuring that research has an impact. The two fields share common elements: the importance of engaging users from the beginning, the significance of pretesting data collection tools and communication materials, and the notion of users taking ownership of evaluation and communication activities and outcomes. 

Building on earlier research, this project focuses on new methodologies for evaluation and communication, and will provide mentorship support and capacity building in these methodologies for Information and Networks researchers across the Global South. It will result in a trained cadre of regional mentors who are able to facilitate advanced methodologies in both evaluation and communications. Participating flagship project teams will develop their evaluation and communication skills, and gain opportunities for policy and practice change. More will be learned about practical issues involved in implementing and combining the new evaluation and communications methodologies.

Its aim is to increase the number of individuals and couples who know their status and who receive information and services that will help avert new infections in Kanyama township in Lusaka and Kalabo district in Western Province.  The Community Compact is a community sensitization and mobilization project that develops and supports community-led HIV prevention strategic plans. Prevention program activities are developed in collaboration with community teams in Kanyama and Kalabo.  
These teams have been trained in HIV/AIDS basics and prevention with positives core messaging.  Teams have also been trained in key messaging on male circumcision, treatment and adherence, pediatric care, Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission, voluntary counseling and testing (CT) and TB. 
CT is provided by trained lay counselors. As an integral part of the project, the community teams work with staff at health centers to improve referral to HIV treatment and care for those who test positive. Improvements have been identified to reduce clinic-based barriers that prevent those that test positive from accessing treatment. 
The project provides CT for couples in the community and provides support for discordant couples. Therefore, it is crucial to promote CT integration with other care and prevention services and provide condoms and safer sex messages to discordant couples.
The Community Compact will also include aspects of health systems strengthening.  The project will try to improve coordination between community teams and the staff at the health centers and between the various departments in the health centre itself, e.g., PMTCT and antiretroviral therapy clinics.",2,2018-01-01,2018-12-31,2018-01-01,2018-12-31,U.S. Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,,,,State Department,US-14,Government,10.0,U.S. Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,,,,CENTER FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND RESEARCH IN ZAMBIA,,,,ZM,Zambia,,,,,12110;3001,Health policy and administrative management;,100;100,;,1;99,1.0,110.0,10.0,C01,5.0,USD,USD,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0

The main components of the Abilis Global Programme are capacity building of persons with disabilities and their organizations disability inclusion and policy dialogue. The overall objective of the programme is that persons with disabilities are aware of th
eir human rights and act for the realization thereof and are in every way equal to their fellow human beings. This is possible when persons with disabilities recognize their human rights and are empowered for independent living. Disability inclusion occurs
 only when the attitude of the community is positive towards disability and the infrastructure of society is supporting implementation of disability rights.The realization of the human rights of persons with disabilities require supporting of rights-holder
s and duty-bearers. This is the focus of the work Abilis carries out in 12 programme countries and in the named fragile states in Asia Africa Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Majority of the project funding is channelled to the least developed countries
 and remote areas where very few other donors can support local groups. Particular attention is paid to women and children with disabilities as many of them experience multiple discrimination. Project funding is given only to organizations of persons with 
disabilities that plan implement monitor and report projects. Thus the entire project cycle builds capacity of grantee organizations. Abilis Foundation has 20-years? worth of experience in project management work with standardized mechanisms and tools and 
a wide network. Results and impacts are monitored through global and country specific indicators developed for the Foundation?s use. Further development work is carried out continuously based on recommendations made in the evaluations. Global Disability Di
plomacy on Human Rights is the initiative for policy dialogue and inclusion in Finland and programme countries as well as globally. Active information and communication work is undertaken in order to share results with the general public and external actor

Den bidrar direkt till att uppfylla målen under stödområde 3: ""bättre möjligheter och verktyg för fattiga occ utsatta människor att förbättra sina levnadsvillkor"" och specifikt till ""stärkt kapacitet hos lokala aktörer att verka för hållbara lösningar av flyktingsituationer och migrationsströmmar samt tillvarata de positiva effekterna av migration"". 

Insatsen bidrar till att stärka Afrikabaserade institutioners kapacitet att hantera och tillvarata de positiva effekterna av migrationen på kontinenten. 

Sverige bidrar med ekonomiskt stöd till de första dryga tre årens genomförande av Joint Labour Migration Programme (JLMP). Målet med insatsen är att utveckla AUCs (Afrikanska Unionens Kommission), RECs (Afrikanska ekonomiska kommissioner) och afrikanska staters kapacitet att implementera programmet med syftet att förbättra arbetsmigrationspolitik och -ledning, arbetsmigrationsstatistik, underlätta migreringspolitikens kompetensportabilitet, stärka utvecklingen av migrationspolitiken på regional- och landnivå samt att stärka migranters rättigheter. Insatsen genomförs av AUC i samarbete med International Labour Organization (ILO), International Organization for Migration (IOM), som är Sidas avtalspart och ansvarar för koordineringen av programmets genomförande, samt tre av kontinentens ekonomiska samarbetsorganisationer: Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Southern African Development Community (SADC), och East African Community (EAC). 35 av afrikanska unionens medlemsstater berörs direkt av stödet. Indirekt förväntas samtliga 54 medlemsstater dra nytta av stödet. Den totala budgeten uppgår till drygt 12 miljoner USD. Sveriges bidrag uppgår till 8.8 miljoner USD, dvs. 73% av det totala budgetbeloppet.

Insatsen förväntas bidra till arbetsmarknadsinstitutioners förbättrade effektivitet och öppenhet vad gäller leverans av arbetsmiljöstyrningstjänster; förbättrade politiska system och regleringssystem för arbetskraftsmigration på land- och regional nivå; ökat stöd för samråd med intressenter och praktisk samordning om arbetskraftsmigration och arbetmigranters rörlighet; samt till att bidra med rådgivande stöd till medlemsstater, RECs och AU. 

Med ovan angivna huvudmål förväntas stödet bidra till följande specifika resultat:

1. Utbildnings- och kapacitetsbyggande program utvecklade,
2. Kapacitetsuppbyggnadsutbildningar genomförda,
3. Rådgivnings- och konsulttjänster för arbetsmarknadsinstitutioners styrning förbättrade,
4. Ökad produktion av arbetsmigrationsinformation,
5. Ökat erkännande av harmoniserade kvalifikationer för arbetsmigranters anställningsbarhet,
6. Förbättrade arbetsmiljöpolitiska ramverk,
7. Aktivt internationellt samarbete för att bygga upp ett samarbetsramverk för arbetskraftmigration med icke-AU-medlemsstater,
8. Förstärkt skydd för arbetsmigranter och arbetskraftsmigration genom internationellt samarbete,
9. Stärkt kapacitet hos AUC, RECs och regionala arbetsmarknadsparter för att effektivt samordna och bidra till regionala och sub-regionala socialförsäkringsprogram för arbetsmigranter,
10. Underlätta för regulära sessioner av AUs arbetsmiljörådgivande kommitté.

AUC och de föreslagna genomförandeorganisationerna ILO och IOM har tidigare erfarenhet av samarbete med Sverige och kapacitet att leverera förväntade resultat. Sidas centrala bedömning av IOMs bekräftar att de har tillräcklig projektlednings- och finansiell kapacitet att hantera insatsen. Detta bedöms också gälla för dess lokala sambandskontor i Addis Abeba. Trots att AUC erhåller finansiellt stöd från Sida för genomförandet av institutionsstärkande projekt inom ramen för det s.k Pillar V, kommer denna insats inte innebära att medel överförs direkt till AUC. IOMs roll är att ansvara för de medel som används för att genomföra de av AUC och RECs planerade projektaktiviteterna.

Documention Center of Cambodia (DC-Cam) söker medel från Ambassaden för att finansiera sitt planerings- och utvecklingsprojekt för Tuol Sleng museet (Tuol Sleng Museum Development Plan Project) under perioden 1 mars 2014 till 28 februari 2015. DC-Cam har sedan många år organiserat liknande projekt med fokus på historisk dokumentation av Khmer Rouge, utbildning om folkmord och ansvarsutkrävande. Det svenska stödet bedöms indirekt främja Khmer Rouge tribunalens (ECCC) arbete för rättvisa och ansvarsutkrävande, då tekniskt stöd från DC-Cam gör det möjligt för museet att ordna fler tillfälliga utställningar om Khmer Rouge i anslutning till utställningen Dinner with Pol Pot. Projektet förväntas öka medvetenheten och kunskapen om folkmordet, och bidra till läkandeprocessen, inte bara för museibesökarna men för hela Kambodjas befolkning, i synnerhet för yngre kambodjaner födda efter regimens fall.",4,,,2012-01-01,2015-04-28,NOT APPLICABLE,,,,Sweden,SE-0,Government,10,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency,SE-6,Government,10,"University, college or other teaching institution, research institute or think-tank",51000.0,"Academic, Training and Research",80.0,KH,Cambodia,100.0,,,,99810,Sectors not specified,100,,1,1.0,110.0,10.0,C01,5.0,USD,,0.0,70359.270404,0.0,0,0.0,0,0

Afrikagrupperna har inkommit med en ansökan om rambidrag på sammanlagt 211 535 000 kr för perioden 2017- 2021. Det ansökta beloppet innebär en viss ökning per år jämfört med mellanåret 2016 och programperioden 2013-2015. Det ansökta beloppet för 2017 är ca 8 % högre än för 2016. Därutöver har Afrikagrupperna ansökt om 13 497 000 SEK från Sidas informations- och kommunikationsanslag för perioden 2017-2020, vilket bereds och beslutas av Sida Partnership Forum (SPF). Afrikagruppernas ansökan för 2017-2021 är en vidareutveckling av ramsamarbetet 2013-2015 samt mellanåret 2016, och erfarenheter baserade på ett långt samarbete med Sida. Kapacitets- och organisationsstärkande insatser utgör fortsatt centrala komponenter. Sida bedömer att Afrikagruppernas ansökan om rambidrag för 2017-2021 är relevant, med undantag för arbetsområdet om Västsahara. 

Sida beslutar att finansiera ansökan med 207 300 000 SEK.

Ansökande organisation:
Afrikagrupperna är en väletablerad organisation i regionen södra Afrika med ett öppet och demokratiskt arbetssätt och med en god förankring i det svenska civila samhället. Kansliet i Stockholm har 15 anställda och regionkontoret i Sydafrika har fem anställda som verkar på plats och ytterligare tre anställda som verkar i respektive land (Mocambique, Angola, Zimbabwe) med täta resor till regionkontoret. Organisationen har 2476 medlemmar verksamma inom tio lokala Afrikagrupper, samt elva medlemsorganisationer som fungerar som stödgrupper bl.a. inom insamlingsverksamhet. Medlemmarnas kunskap, engagemang och solidaritet utgör ryggraden i Afrikagruppernas verksamhet. Afrikagruppernas styrelse har inflytande över strategisk inriktning och övergripande planering. Under 2016 har Afrikagrupperna genomgått en rad verksamhetsförändringar (Se nedan rubrik ""Verksamhetsförändringar""). Afrikagrupperna har ändrat sin metod från att i huvudsak arbeta landbaserat, till att arbeta regionalt och temabaserat. Afrikagrupperna har även ökat sin rättighetsbaserade ansats genom att anta ett övergripande feministiskt förhållningssätt och ett utökat samarbete med en rad nya mer förändringsbenägna aktörer (aktivistiska nätverk och folkrörelser). Afrikagrupperna har i samband med detta stängt ner samtliga landkontor i regionen och öppnat ett nytt regionkontor i Sydafrika som skall styra verksamheten och administrationen. Sida bedömer att verksamhetsförändringarna och det tematiska upplägget har bidragit till att Afrikagrupperna och dess samarbetsorganisationer kan arbeta på ett mer enhetligt och effektivt sätt med sina teman i hela regionen. Det bör möjliggöra besparingar, samt bidra till synergier och ökat lärande mellan partners i regionen. 

Verksamhetsförändringar:
1. Regionalt och temabaserat arbetssätt
2. Förstärkt regionkontor i Johannesburg 
3. Ökad rättighetsbaserad ansats och utökad partnerportfölj
4. Stärkt jämställdhetsprofil och feministiskt förhållningssätt 
5. Nytt arbetsområde - ""Ett fritt Västsahara"" (se nedan rubrik ""Västsahara"")

Ansökan:
Ansökan bygger på samarbetsorganisationernas egna prioriteringar och utgör en logisk konsekvens av det nya temabaserade arbetssättet med ökat regionalt fokus och ökad rättighetsbaserad ansats. Insatsen avser fortsatt ett sammanhållet program i fem länder (Angola, Mocambique, Namibia, Sydafrika, Zimbabwe) med stöd till 29 partnerorganisationer som alla bedriver rättighetsbaserat arbete med verksamhet inom ett eller flera av nedanstående områden.

Tematiska områden:
1. Styrning över naturresurser
2. Matsuveränitet
3. Sexuella reproduktiva rättigheter och HIV
4. Arbets- och levnadsvillkor

Västsahara:
Afrikagrupperna har i sin ansökan inkluderat ett nytt arbetsområde kallat ""Ett fritt Västsahara"". Det är ett pilotprojekt beräknat till 4 200 000 kr, vilket motsvarar ca 2% av insatsbudgeten. Syftet är att Afrikagrupperna skall kunna stärka sitt informations- och påverkansarbete gentemot Sveriges regering, svenska riksdagsledamöter och EU för att upp",2,,,2017-01-01,2022-08-28,AFRIKAGRUPPERNA,,,,Sweden,SE-0,Government,10,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency,SE-6,Government,10,Donor country-based NGO,22000.0,National NGO,22.0,ZA,South Africa,100.0,,,,43040,Rural development,100,,1,1.0,110.0,10.0,B03,5.0,USD,,679357.6693569999,673635.455217,0.0,0,0.0,0,0

PRRO genomförs i Kenya under perioden oktober 2011 till oktober 2014 till stöd för flyktingar och den kenyanska värdbefolkningen. På grund av ökande kostnader och otillräckliga medel har WFP tvingats skära ned matransonerna i flyktinglägren under november och december 2013 med 20 % i väntan på ytterligare stöd under 2014. Nedskärningarna medför försämrade levnadsvillkor och riskerar att ses som en del av det politiska trycket att påskynda repatrieringen av somaliska flyktingar vilket vore ytterst olyckligt. Det svenska stödet möjliggör att matransonerna återställs till normal nivå och förväntas bidra till ökad matsäkerhet och bättre levnadsvillkor både för flyktingar och värdbefolkningen. Insatsen är av humanitär karaktär och genomförs under kort tid.

Services are scarce, and cultural norms prevent women from speaking out when they suffer violence.   This project will establish relationships, including with the male traditional leaders, to encourage women to come forward, and also to change mens behaviour in the future.  The project will respond both to the immediate needs of women for accessible support services, including medical help, and also work with communities to address root factors that perpetuate violence, subordination and discrimination against women.  It will work with local leaders and duty bearers to increase public consciousness and increased responsiveness towards the safety, protection and well-being of survivors and women and girls at risk of violence. There will be cross-learning between the two implementing partners, which will lead to improved good practice.

Det stödjer landsbygden och är viktigt för ekonomisk tillväxt. Totalt bidrar jordbruket med nära 20% av kontinentens BNP och runt hälften av det totala värdet av all afrikansk export. Samtidigt har Afrika söder om Sahara för närvarande den högsta förekomsten av undernäring, och cirka 16% av den totala befolkningen saknar tillräckligt med mat.Tyvärr förväntas klimatförändringarna ha en mycket stor påverkan på produktionen inom jordbruket i Afrika söder om Sahara som redan är en av de fattigaste regionerna i världen med en osäker livsmedelsförsörjning. Till exempel uppskattar man att klimatförändringen 2080 kommer framtvinga en import av hela 143 miljoner ton spannmål, vilket är en enorm ökning från dagens cirka 7 miljoner ton. Behovet av att föda en växande befolkning på en allt mer begränsad landyta kommer att kräva nya verktyg för att påskynda utvecklingen av jordbruket.Vi tror att bioteknik kan spela en viktig framtida roll för att förbättra effektiviteten inom jordbruket och livsmedelsproduktionen på den afrikanska kontinenten. Hållbart jordbruk kombinerar ökad jordbruksproduktion och ekonomisk utveckling samtidigt som det främjar miljöskydd och en mer rättvis fördelning av inkomster. För att nå sin fulla potential, måste jordbruksbioteknik framgångsrikt införlivas i ett hållbart jordbruk. Med rätt användning kan det mildra en del av Afrikas kroniska problem såsom matbrist och brist på näringsrik mat. I det här projektet fokuserar vi på de viktiga stapelgrödorna kassava och potatis. Kassava odlas flitigt i Afrika eftersom den inte behöver näringsrika jordar och är relativt torktålig. Flera hundra miljoner människor är beroende av denna gröda för sin överlevnad idag. Potatis är också en mycket viktig stapelgröda, och har under de senaste 20 åren odlats i kraftigt ökande omfattning i Afrika. Men dessa grödor lider av två olika problem: kassavan är näringsfattig, särskilt när det gäller provitamin A, som är nödvändig för att motverka allvarliga bristsjukdomar, till exempel blindhet, medan potatisen lätt blir angripen av potatisbladmögel vilket leder till stora skördebortfall om den inte rikligt besprutas med bekämpningsmedel.Förbättrade sorter av dessa grödor är ofta det enda alternativ som resurssvaga odlare kan förlita sig på i ett mer lågintensivt jordbruk med små ekonomiska resurser att använda till gödning och bekämpningsmedel. Men att förädla kassava och potatis på traditionellt sätt är svårt, eftersom de är mycket genetiskt diversa och har långa livscykler. Många korsningar slutar i oförutsägbara och ovälkomna egenskapskombinationer. Därför vill vi använda de biotekniska verktyg som de facto finns tillgängliga för att med ökad precision förbättra motståndskraften mot växtsjukdomar och öka näringsvärdet av kassava och potatis.Sverige och andra EU-länder har många bi- och multilaterala forsknings- och utvecklingssamarbeten med länder i Afrika söder om Sahara. Policyutvecklingen för forskning och tillämpning av växtbioteknik i dessa afrikanska länder har stor påverkan på möjligheten att bedriva denna typ av samarbeten, och det är därför ytterst viktigt att följa, och även stödja med hjälp av expertrådgivning, framväxten av dessa regelverk i Afrika söder om Sahara. Detta har även betydelse för en stabil livsmedelsförsörjning i många av dessa länder, eftersom internationell handel med jordbruksprodukter underlättas av harmoniserade regelverk.I detta förslag vill vi stärka både tekniska framsteg och policyer kring växtbioteknik i länderna söder om Sahara genom att ta itu med två huvudfrågor:1) Utvecklingen och kapacitetsuppbyggnad av växtbioteknik och speciellt genomredigering i SSA2) Jämföra skillnader och likheter inom växtbioteknikpolicyer mellan EU och Afrika.Genom att angripa dessa tre frågor räknar vi med att bidra med en kapacitetsuppbyggnad inom växtbioteknik i Afrika söder om Sahara. Dessutom vill vi knyta dessa bitvis nya tekniker till nya policyer för vä",2,2019-01-01,2020-12-31,2019-01-01,,,,,,Sweden,SE-0,Government,10,The Swedish Research Council,SE-29,Government,10,Sveriges lantbruksuniversitet,51000.0,"Academic, Training and Research",80.0,UG,Uganda,100.0,,,,31182,Agricultural research,100,,1,1.0,110.0,10.0,D02,,USD,,30685.199760000003,5114.148945,0.0,0,0.0,0,0

De combinatie van de interne crisis in Irak en de regionale crisis door de oorlog in Syrië, leidden in Irak tot een van de meest dynamische en volatiele crisissen in de wereld. Eind 2015 beliep het totaal aantal vluchtelingen 3,2 miljoen. In mei 2015, net voor de oprichting van het Iraq Humanitarian Pooled Fund (ICHF), hadden 8,2 miljoen Irakezen nood aan humanitaire hulp. 
Sinds de oprichting van het ICHF in juni 2015 heeft het fonds ingestaan voor de tijdige toekenning van financiering aan NGOs en VN-organisaties om te beantwoorden aan de meest kritieke humanitaire noden, in lijn met de strategie van het Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP). Met een initieel budget van 22,7 miljoen US dollar (bijdragen van het Verenigd Koninkrijk, Nederland, Duitsland, Ierland en Zweden), stond het ICHF in voor de leniging van de meest kritieke noden, op een moment dat de vele humanitaire programmas in Irak hun activiteiten afbouwden. In 2015 hielp het fonds 6,2 miljoen personen, waarvan 87%. Het meest recente overzicht van donorbijdragen en financieringstoekenningen van het IHPF vindt u in het 2016 First Standard Allocation van 1 maart 2016 (bijlage 7).

Het ICHF kenden 54% van zijn financiering toe aan NGOs en 46% aan VN-instellingen. 29% van de totale financiering was bestemd voor nationale NGOs. Daarmee is het fonds het best geplaatste mechanisme om lokale humanitaire actoren te financieren. Humanitaire financiering voor nationale en lokale NGOs (local responders) is een beleid dat België herhaaldelijk heeft onderschreven, laatst op de World Humanitarian Summit in Istanboel.

Er wurde im Dezember 2005 unter Führung der KfW aufgelegt und hat sich seit seiner Gründung innerhalb kurzer Zeit zum Leuchtturmprojekt der deutschen Entwicklungszusammenarbeit (EZ) entwickelt. Der Fonds fokussiert seine Aktivitäten auf die Kreditvergabe an kleinste, kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KKMU) sowie an private Haushalte im Rahmen von Wohnraummodernisierungsmaßnahmen in den Ländern Südosteuropas und der Türkei sowie in der östlichen europäischen Nachbarschaftsregion (ENR). Dabei stellt der EFSE ausgewählten und qualifizierten Partnerinstitutionen vor Ort langfristige Refinanzierungsmittel zu Marktkonditionen zur Verfügung, die dann an die genannten Zielgruppen entsprechende Kreditfazilitäten ausreichen. Der Fonds weist eine innovative Public-Private-Partnership-Struktur auf, die durch ein gemeinsames Engagement von öffentlichen und privaten Kapitalgebern in den inzwischen 16 Zielländern des EFSE gekennzeichnet ist. Als Gesellschafter qualifizieren sich sowohl öffentliche Geber (wie nationale Regierungen oder Zentralbanken sowie supranationale Institutionen), nationale und internationale Förderinstitute und institutionelle Privatinvestoren, wobei diese je nach ihrer individuellen Risikobereitschaft in verschiedene Tranchen (Risikoklassen) und Notes investieren können. Sitz des Fonds ist Luxemburg. Als Rechtsform wurde die Form einer Investmentgesellschaft mit variablem Kapital (SICAV-FIS) gewählt. Diese Struktur wurde seit seiner Gründung in verschiedenen Regionen mehrfach erfolgreich repliziert. Der EFSE weist sehr gute wirtschaftliche Ergebnisse und eine hohe entwicklungspolitische Zielerreichung auf. Aufgrund des revolvierenden Einsatzes der Mittel stehen den Zielgruppen dauerhaft und langfristig Refinanzierungsmittel zur Verfügung. Des Weiteren verfügt der EFSE über eine ""Development Facility"", die u.a. der Finanzierung von personellen Beratungsmaßnahmen für kooperierende und potenzielle Partnerinstitutionen dienen. Diese Fazilität wird sowohl aus Zuschüssen als auch aus erwirtschafteten Erträgen des Fonds gespeist. ",3.0,2016-03-29,2025-03-29,2015-12-14,2016-04-04,KfW Bankengruppe (KfW),XM-DAC-5-2,,,Germany,DE-1,Government,10.0,Bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (BMZ),DE-1,Government,10.0,EFSE,,,,,,,89,"Europe, regional",100,24030,Formal sector financial intermediaries,100,,1,,,10.0,,3.0,EUR,,15000000.0,15000000.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

Ministry for Foreign Affairs has just published the Strategy for Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid in response to the conflicts in Syria and Iraq for 2017-2020. Finnish assistance to Syrian conflict exceeds 35 Million Euros in 2017 and 45 Millio
n to Iraq. Financing needs are not likely to decline during 2018. The MENA-unit is responsible for the overall monitoring of the strategy. Roughly 8 million Euros is directly on its project portfolio.The Finnish support to Syria and Iraq is thematically br
oad and changing conflict dynamics require a great deal of flexibility. Thus funds are needed for monitoring the existing (amounting to roughly 26 million Euros) and preparing the new interventions. Finnish funds are channeled through UN agencies World Ban
k Syria Recovery Trust Fund and (I)NGOs. Most of the monitoring is done by the MFA and Embassies' staff but also assessments audits and evaluations are contracted to support this function.

Areas A and B contained the highest density of Palestinian residents, while Area C contained the most land  60% of the entire West Bank. The land comprising Area C, and its residents, remained under civil and military control of Israel. The number of Israeli settlers moving into Area C has quadrupled, and shows no sign of slowing - the 300,000 Palestinians living in Area C are now outnumbered by Israeli settlers. Those still residing within Area C live under constant threat of home demolitions and displacement, and without permission to use the land for traditional herding and agriculture practices many are dependent on humanitarian aid for survival. For the children of Area C, this translates to a life of marginalisation, worry, and vulnerability. Their childhood is marked by poverty and lack of opportunities, poor nutrition and ill-health, limited access to health and education services in their areas, and fear of harassment while travelling to more distant services. Many experience frequent displacement and constant fear of forced transfer, demolition of their homes and schools, or violence from neighbouring settlements. In the absence of other opportunities, children resort to physical labour in the neighbouring Israeli settlements, sometimes experience child-labour related illness and disability as a result.",3.0,2017-02-01,2017-09-30,2017-04-01,2017-09-30,War Child Holland (leading),NL-KVK-41215393,,,War Child Holland (funding),NL-KVK-41215393,,,,,,,Defense for Children International Palestine (DCI) (co implementing),,,,PS,"Palestinian Territory, Occupied",100,,,,11230;15160;16010;16065;91010,Basic life skills for youth and adults;;Social/ welfare services;;Administrative costs,11;25;51;5;8,;;;;,1;1;1;1;1,1.0,110.0,10.0,C01,5.0,EUR,EUR,134510,247549,87014,20143,0.0,0,0

Nevertheless, the vast western region of the country tends to lag behind the dynamic eastern coastline. The gap between the two is an ongoing matter of concern to both central and regional governments. During its 1999 economic conference, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China released a strategy for the development of the western region that included (among other things) revamping the infrastructure, reviewing fiscal policies, promoting trade and investment, and strengthening science and technology (S&T) and innovation capability. This grant will allow the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) to undertake a three-year project designed to enhance indigenous technological innovation and competitiveness in the western region. The project will be implemented through a competitive process involving an annual call for proposals on specific themes, as determined by a Steering Committee of experts drawn from government agencies, universities and research institutions all over the country.

hout basic education. Fida partners with the Assemblies of God (AOG) church of Peshawar in order to address the needs of the people in North West Pakistan. The project comprises of three main components: Community Health Education (CHE) in the local villag
es, adult literacy classes and the establishment of a pre-school. Fida and AOG work together in the local communities, which provide the partner with hands-on training in practical community development work. As the partner?s capacities build up, the socia
l work the church does will improve. The CHE component will help the communities in becoming the main actors in their own development and the pre-school will provide the children with much-needed education. These elements together will contribute towards t
he overall improvement in life management and quality of life in the local communities.

It specifically attempts to craft theories to characterize the complex and dynamic relationship between two policy research groups: think tanks and universities. 

The project will examine the impact that externally provided support has on relationships between think tanks and universities. The research team will analyze case studies by drawing on focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and secondary data sources. They will also conduct detailed studies of selected institutions in three countries: Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. More specifically, this project will:
- contribute to shaping theoretical and conceptual frameworks to guide future research on this issue;
- generate recommendations for support to think tanks to foster mutually beneficial relationships and/or generate positive outcomes for both think tanks and universities; and,
- widely disseminate research results among local, regional, and global stakeholders to help influence policy and practice. 

South Asia has seen a marked increase in the number of universities and think tanks assuming more proactive and visible roles in policy-related research. Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan offer opportunities for comparative analysis because they present a variety of research knowledge environments. 

The project team will identify cases in each of the countries which will help capture differences in relationship patterns between think tanks and universities. The study will also help explain the role that external supports play in shaping these patterns. The project is expected to generate insights that will help key stakeholders revisit their practices in order to strengthen the overall policy-relevant knowledge environment in the region. This is one of three studies on think tank-university relationships, with other studies taking place in Latin America and Africa.",4.0,,,2013-06-19,2014-07-19,Sustainable Development Policy Institute,,Regional NGO,23.0,Netherlands.

We Effect har inkommit med en ansökan om rambidrag för 2017 på sammanlagt SEK 188 033 400 för en ettårig förlängning av det program som genomförs under ramanslaget 2014-2016. Sida har därför beslutat att bereda insatsen som ett kompletterande insatsbeslut. Sida bedömer att ansökan är relevant under den nya strategin för stöd genom Svenska organisationer i det civila samhället (CSO-strategin) 2016-2022 och beslutar om ett bidrag om 180 000 000 SEK. Denna beredning har genomförts i samarbete mellan handläggare Eva-Lotta Gustafsson och USAID:s sekondering till Sida Joshua Haynes.

Ansökande organisation: 

We Effect är en ideell, partipolitiskt och religiöst obunden organisation vars syfte är att stärka medlemsbaserade och demokratiska organisationers förmåga att göra det möjligt för fattiga kvinnor och män att förbättra sina levnadsvillkor, försvara sina rättigheter och bidra till ett rättvist samhälle. We Effect bildades 1958 och har varit ramorganisation sedan 1978 under namnet Kooperation Utan Gränser. Organisationen är en demokratiskt strukturerad förening och bakom We Effect står ett sextiotal medlemsorganisationer från den svenska konsument- och producentkooperationen. We Effect är en väletablerad organisation i det svenska samhället, med ett öppet och demokratiskt arbetssätt - och med en stark internationell förankring.

We Effects vision är en hållbar och rättvis värld fri från fattigdom och organisationen arbetar inom landsbygdsutveckling och bostäder, inkluderat rätten till mark, jämställdhet och finansiella tjänster. Ansökan omfattar 17 program på regional eller landnivå och ett globalt program som totalt består av 160 projekt i 24 länder. 

Sida beslutade 2014 att förnya We Effects status som ramorganisation. 

Ansökan:

Ansökan bygger på We Effects prioriteringar och följer logiskt på tidigare verksamhet. We Effects ramansökan för 2017 är en fortsättning på det ramprogram som genomförs under pågående ramavtal 2014-2016.

Syftet med stödet är att stärka partnerorganisationen som sådan och att detta i sin tur ökar organisationens förmåga att å ena sidan påverka och kräva förändring på makronivå/strukturell nivå och, å andra sidan erbjuda medlemmarna efterfrågade tjänster. Enligt We Effects förändringsteori genomförs den huvudsakliga verksamheten av partnerorganisationerna. Inom programmen för landsbygdsutveckling stödjer We Effect bondeorganisationer i deras arbete med att öka sina medlemmars inkomster och tillgång till mat genom t.ex. jordbruksrådgivning, stärkt position på marknaden och hjälp med förhandlingar om priser. Organisationen förespråkar ett hållbart och klimatanpassat jordbruk och stödjer också lokala spar- och kreditföreningar som gör det möjligt för lantbrukare med små resurser att spara och låna pengar samt få tillgång till försäkringar. Inom bostadsprogrammen arbetar We Effect med lokala bostadskooperativ där medlemmarna tillsammans bygger sina bostäder. Kooperativen bedriver påverkansarbete för tillgång till bostadskrediter och säkrad rätt till mark att bygga på. Jämställdhet är ett prioriterat område för We Effects verksamhet. We Effect strävar efter att integrera jämställdhet i all verksamhet och organisationen stödjer partnerorganisationernas arbete med att stärka kvinnors rättigheter, bland annat genom kvinnligt ledarskap, en mer rättvis arbetsfördelning i jordbruket samt genom att försvara kvinnors rätt till mark. 

Målgruppen för We Effects utvecklingssamarbete är kvinnor och män som lever i fattigdom och som är medlemmar, eller potentiella medlemmar, i kooperativa organisationer, andra demokratiska föreningar eller informella grupper vilka arbetar för att uppnå gemensamma mål.

Förväntade resultat:

We Effects ansökan har resultatmatriser på land- och regional nivå, med indikatorer och utgångsvärden. På global nivå finns en resultatmatris men utan aggregerade utgångs- och målvärden. Ansökan har följande mål:

Det nu aktuella stödet till Internationella Rödakorskommittén (ICRC) baseras på Sidas humanitära allokeringsprocess, som färdigställdes under slutet av 2017. 

Aktuell insats bygger vidare på tidigare års stöd till ICRC, där Sverige, bland annat genom Sida, har varit en av ICRC:s betydande givare åtminstone sedan 1953. Sidas årliga stöd till ICRC befästes 2014 då ett strategiskt partnerskap, genom ett treårigt avtal, signerades. Det treåriga avtalet förlängdes senare för att också inkludera 2017. Ett nytt treårigt avtal (2018-2020) föreslås nu för att möjliggöra en fortsatt strategisk ansats i relation och partnerskap med ICRC. Det nu föreslagna stödet avses kompletteras med ytterligare stöd genom beslutade avtalsändringar och kompletterande insatsbeslut för åren 2018-2020, under förutsättning att riksdagen anvisar nödvändiga finansiella medel samt baserat på bedömd relevans i kommande allokeringsprocesser. 

För 2018 föreslås att 450 miljoner SEK allokeras till ICRC för implementeringen av insatser i 36 kontexter (varav 8 är regionala och därmed täcker flera länder). Av den initiala allokeringen utgör 115 miljoner SEK oallokerat stöd, vilket ger ICRC flexibilitet att tillskjuta ytterligare finansiella medel till länder och regioner med ökade humanitära behov eller som är kraftigt underfinansierade. Sida måste dock, enligt avtal, godkänna ICRC:s förslag på hur det oallokerade stödet allokeras. För överblick och fördelning av stöd hänvisas till avtalets bilaga III (Budget summary). 

För 2019 och 2020 föreslås att 5 miljoner SEK allokeras till ICRC per år som oallokerat stöd, vilket ger ett totalt beslutsbelopp om 460 miljoner SEK.

BAKGRUND

ICRC utgör en av de främsta humanitära aktörerna i länder och kontexter med väpnad konflikt, med ett mandat i den internationella humanitära rätten (IHR). ICRC:s övergripande mål är att skydda liv och värdighet hos människor utsatta för väpnad konflikt och andra situationer av våld, genom bland annat att säkerställa evakuering från krigszoner, upprätthållande av temporära boendelösningar (shelter) och basala förnödenheter såsom mat, vatten och sanitet. ICRC:s målgrupper är definierade inom IHR och utgörs av civila, frihetsberövade, sårade och sjuka. Efter att ha gjort en behovsanalys kombinerar ICRC fyra metoder för att, direkt eller indirekt, på kort, medellång eller lång sikt, arbeta för att upprätthålla respekt för liv, värdighet och fysiskt samt psykiskt välbefinnande hos dem som drabbas av väpnade konflikter och andra situationer av våld. Dessa metoder syftar till att förhindra (förebyggande), utrota orsaken (skydd) och lindra (bistånd/materiellt stöd) mänskligt lidande i en väpnad konflikt eller andra situationer av våld samt att stärka Röda Kors/Halvmåne-rörelsen (samarbete). Uppföljning och utvärdering är också avgörande för denna process, liksom samordningen med de många aktörer som finns på den alltmer komplexa humanitära scenen.

ICRC presenterade sin humanitära appell för 2018 under december månad 2017. Detta är en givargemensam appell och budget, indelad efter länder samt regioner. Sida begär inte in en egen ansökan eller budget. ICRC inkom också i december 2017 med ett förslag på hur ett eventuellt stöd från Sida skulle fördelas på landprogram, baserat på humanitära behov och finansiella resurser. 

ICRC:s totala budget för 2018 uppgår till 2,016.8 miljoner CHF (c:a 17 miljarder SEK), varav 218,4 miljoner CHF (c:a 1,8 miljarder SEK; motsvarande 10,8 % av den totala budgeten) går till huvudkontorets särskilda appell, vilken utgår från huvudkontorets verksamhet. Huvudkontorsappellen stöds årligen av UD, med kärnstöd uppmätt kring cirka 100 miljoner SEK per år. Resterande budget om 1,798.3 miljoner CHF (c:a 15,1 miljarder SEK) går",2,,,2018-02-01,2021-12-28,ICRC/INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE O,,,,Sweden,SE-0,Government,10,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency,SE-6,Government,10,International Committee of the Red Cross,21016.0,International NGO,21.0,PS,"Palestinian Territory, Occupied",100.0,,,,72010,Material relief assistance and services,100,,1,1.0,110.0,10.0,C01,5.0,USD,,3108878.762772,3108878.762772,0.0,0,0.0,0,0

Under 2018 kommer fler än 135 miljoner människor vara i behov av humanitärt bistånd världen över till en kostnad av 22,5 miljarder dollar enligt United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Sveriges humanitära bistånd är behovsbaserat och Sida genomför i enlighet med detta årligen en humanitär allokeringsprocess, vari samtliga humanitära kriser analyseras utifrån de humanitära behoven och där de mest relevanta av strategiska partnerorganisationer att svara upp mot identifierade behov utväljs.

Ett flertal av de identifierade globala behoven för 2018 återfinns i utdragna och bortglömda kriser och Sida bedömer att Oxfam GB är väl positionerad att svara upp mot dessa behov i kraft av att organisationen även arbetar med långsiktigt utvecklingssamarbete, har god kännedom om den lokala kontexten i samtliga föreslagna projekt samt genom att kapacitetsstärkande av lokala aktörer är centralt i Oxfam GBs humanitära arbete. År 20182021 föreslås därför att Oxfam GB, utöver stöd för akut livräddande aktiviteter, även erhåller finansiering för mer långsiktiga aktiviteter i syfte att stärka samhällens motståndskraft mot kriser och katastrofer.

Oxfam GB har under tidigare samarbeten med Sida, senast genom stöd under avtalsperioden 20112013 samt 20142017, påvisat att organisationen är en effektiv humanitär aktör. Enbart under 2016 lyckades Oxfam GB nå 1,2 miljoner människor med stöd inom vatten, sanitet och hygien, 94 000 människor med tryggad livsmedelsförsörjning och förbättrade försörjningsmöjligheter samt bidra med stärkt skydd för 106 000 människor i konfliktdrabbade miljöer. Sida bedömer i linje med detta att Oxfam GB framförallt har ett mervärde vad gäller aktiviteter inom tryggad livsmedelsförsörjning, genom matdistribution och kontantbaserat stöd; försörjningsmöjligheter, bland annat genom stöd till återhämtning inom boskapsskötsel och jordbruk; vatten, sanitet och hygien, både genom akut livräddande aktiviteter och långsiktiga aktiviteter i syfte att stärka vattensystem; samt skydd, såväl genom integrering av skydd i exempelvis matdistribution som specifika skyddsaktiviteter i syfte att exempelvis öka medvetenheten om könsbaserat våld. Oxfam arbetar även aktivt med påverkansarbete kring internationell humanitär rätt och de humanitära principerna.

År 2018-2021 planerar Oxfam GB att nå över 280 000 personer i Algeriet, Centralafrikanska republiken, Demokratiska republiken Kongo, Irak och Tchad. Insatsen kommer bestå av fyra komponenter med fokus på akut livräddande aktiviteter; projekt i syfte att stärka samhällens motståndskraft mot kriser och katastrofer; möjlighet att snabbt svara upp mot hastigt uppkomna behov i nya kriser eller akuta försämringar av pågående kriser inom ramen för snabbinsatsmekanismen RRM; samt stärkt effektivitet i det humanitära systemet genom metodstöd som syftar till att öka kunskapen om kontantbaserat stöd.

Sida bedömer att Oxfam GBs planerade projekt svarar mot aktuella humanitära behov i enlighet med Sidas geografiska analys och stöd till den föreslagna insatsen bedöms som relevant för att uppnå målen i Strategi för Sveriges humanitära bistånd genom Styrelsen för internationellt utvecklingssamarbete (Sida) 20172020. Sida föreslår därför att stödja Oxfam GBs humanitära projekt till en kostnad av 104 MSEK i enlighet med följande:

Landprojekt

Två 1-åriga projekt föreslås finansieras med totalt 5 MSEK med följande fördelning:

Demokratiska republiken Kongo: 1 MSEK
I Demokratiska republiken Kongo planerar Oxfam GB att stödja ett INGO-forum med 100 icke-statliga medlemsorganisationer i syfte att öka effektiviteten av humanitärt bistånd genom stärkt samordning.

Irak: 4 MSEK
I Irak föreslås att Sida stödjer ett projekt som riktar sig till 9 600 personer med livräddande aktiviteter inom bland annat vatten, sanit",2,,,2018-03-01,2021-12-28,OXFAM,,,,Sweden,SE-0,Government,10,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency,SE-6,Government,10,OXFAM International,21501.0,International NGO,21.0,SN,Senegal,100.0,,,,72040,Emergency food aid,100,,1,1.0,110.0,10.0,C01,5.0,USD,,186412.593206,186412.593206,0.0,0,0.0,0,0

In 2008 Zambia Federation of Disability Organisations (ZAFOD) with the support of Irish Aid through Power4Good Ireland launched a three years project called Advancing Disability Equality Project (ADEPt) whose aim is to set legal precedents in the violation
 of the rights of persons with disabilities. During this period a large number of high profile legal cases on accessibility to public buildings / institutions, employment rights violations and social exclusion issues were handled. In its three year tenure 
the project focussed on handling rights violation matters from within Lusaka Province. Subsequent to this funding was secured by the ADEPt Senior team from the Finnish Embassy to extend the life of the project for a further one year from September 2010 and
 vitally to expand the service being provided to Western and Northern Provinces by the attachment of qualified Caseworkers to ZAFOD Offices in these Provinces and the establishment of appropriate referral mechanisms.The mission of the project is to ensure 
sustained protection defense and advancement of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons with disabilities in Zambia. The purpose is to establish principles and precedents which achieve improved rights of persons with disabilities through capac
ity building litigation and publicity. The precedents are notably around key issues/themes of i) access ii) education iii) employment iv) women and children v) electoral process vi) health and vii) HIV /Aids. Activities include: 1) Casework support and out
reach 2) individual litigation 3) strategic litigation (public interest litigation) 4) accessibility audits and 5) advocacy and awareness raising. Special emphasis will be given to women and children with disabilities. A template for replication of project

De tjänster som normalt omfattas utgörs av kredit, sparande, transfereringar och försäkring. Stora framsteg har gjorts på området under de senaste 20 åren och andelen som helt står utanför det formella systemet minskar stadigt men utvecklingen har inte skettlikartat överallt. Stora utmaningar återstår dock vad gäller att minska gendergapet och att säkerställa att utvecklandet av tjänsterna sker efterfrågestyrt och exempelvis motverkar ohållbar skuldsättning. 

Finansiell inkludering utgör inte ett mål i sig men har identifierats som en viktig flaskhals och hinder för en positiv utveckling. Insatsen och verksamheten befinner sig i skärningspunkten med flera områden med relevans för strategin för hållbar ekonomisk utveckling såsom privatsektorutveckling, sysselsättning, finansiell stabilitet, migration, livsmedelstrygghet, kvinnors ekonomiska egenmakt och digitalisering. Just den digitala revolutionen har totalt förändrat förutsättningarna för att kostnadseffektivt nå nya grupper med nya typer av tjänster. I ett vidare perspektiv är betalningsfrågor kopplade till energi, vatten, utbildning och hälsa också relevanta i detta sammanhang.

Tidigare utvärderingar har pekat på CGAPs förmåga att tidigt identifiera relevanta frågor och därmed kunnat påverka dagordningen. Den nu aktuella strategin har formulerats utifrån önskemålet att kunna vara flexibel men samtidigt ändå agera inom givna ramar vilka kan härledas ur den förändringsteori som tagits fram som en del av formulerandet av den nya strategin. Att skapa en sammanhängande förändringsteori som direkt korrelerar med resultatramverket var en av rekommendationerna från den senaste utvärderingen.

Fyra sammanlänkade prioriteringar identifierades som alla bidrar till det övergripande målet att: Fattiga människor ska kunna utnyttja möjligheter och bygga motståndskraft. (Poor people are able to capture opportunities and build resilience)

Prioriteringarna utgörs av:
* Skapa mervärde för kunder (creating customer value)
* Utveckla affärsmodeller (emerging business models)
* Stödjande infrastruktur (enabling infrastructure)
* Framåtblickande riktlinjer (next generation policy)

The contribution from Danida is being used to meet the immediate food needs of more vulnerable persons in Jebel Marra area and enable them to restore their livelihoods. This intervention targets 10,000 households in Jebel Marra Area ¿ approximately 50,000 direct beneficiariesl ¿ who will have improved access to food. DRC has identified and targetted the most vulnerable communities and also the most vulnerable members within each community - identified by the community themselves, and then verified by DRC staff. This intervention prioritises support to vulnerable female headed households, followed by the more vulnerable male headed households. The main activities are: 1. Provision of agricultural production support for 10,000 extremely vulnerable households (50,000 beneficiaries) to enable them to contribute to their food requirement by their own means and restore and safeguard livelihoods. 2. Distribution of winter seeds and training to 10,000 extremely vulnerable farming households (50,000 beneficiaries). The winter seed distribution will further reinforce the communities¿ food security capacity and contribute to minimizing the IPC forecasted decline into phase 4 food security status. Winter season crops include tomatoes, garlic, and onion, and beneficiaries will receive seeds adequate to plant 0.42 hectares of land. The project will preferentially use a seed vouchers system since some seeds are available in the neighbouring local markets.

et iii) un système de gestion des finances publiques plus efficace et efficient. Le PARE III sest exécuté de manière
satisfaisante, en dépit du fait que lannée 2010 était une année électorale, ce qui aurait pu compromettre la stabilité

NIMD has supported politicians from different parties to work together by helping them to set up issues oriented multiparty dialogue platforms in Parliament, such as on gender or national minorities. NIMD helps the parties to build their capacity to function effectively by helping them to develop strategic plans and giving them training. NIMD also works on democracy education with democracy schools in 4 different regions, focusing particularly on developing the abilities of political parties, people working for civil society organizations, and local governments to lobby about issues that need addressing.    Programme deviations/ToC update:  It is notable that external factors, namely the political developments in the country also influenced cooperation with political parties. Firstly, the ruling coalition - Georgian Dream fall apart, secondly, United National Movement (UNM) started to boycott the parliamentary sessions after the incident in Kortskheli (May 22, 2016), when supporters of government party physically assaulted the opposition leaders and lastly, after elections UNM party split into groups. It is also worth mentioning that only three parties (GD, UNM, AoP) were able to overcome the five percent threshold, leaving both liberal parties (FDs and Republicans) out of the parliament.

 Explain if the ToC is still valid, or whether there is a need to adapt the ToC and/or the strategy for capacity building based on unforeseen developments
There are only three parties left in parliament, in part because of the threshold. The current ruling party has a supermayority and the ability the change the constitution by itself. The pro-western liberal parties, which always had a strong relationship both with NIMD as well as directly with Dutch political parties (VVD, D66), have failed to overcome the threshold. This does not seem to be a healthy democratic situation, as there is virtually only 1 opposition party left. Therefore, NIMD will focus more on a more pluralistic political arena and the capacity building of opposition parties in 2017.",1,2016-01-01,2016-12-31,2016-01-01,,,,,,OSCE,,Multilateral,40,,,,,NIMD Eastern European Neighbourhood,,International NGO,21,GE,Georgia,100,,,,15152,Legislatures and political parties,100,OECD Development Assistance Committee,DAC,1.0,110.0,10.0,B03,5.0,EUR,EUR,214430.0,185516,48299,0,0.0,0,0.0

This surge in violence has resulted in large-scale displacement of people from their homes, greater need to provide protection for people, and the destruction of assets, livelihoods, and basic infrastructure. People in affected areas are already extremely vulnerable due to chronic poverty and underdevelopment, poor governance, and very limited access to basic services. Cholera, measles, and malaria continue to take a toll across the country but are particularly prevalent in areas of high displacement. In addition, an estimated 6.35 million people across the country are acutely food insecure, or without access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food, including 1.2 million children who are malnourished.   With the support of DFATD and other donors, the United Nations World Food Programme is providing life-saving food assistance to an estimated two million conflict-affected and displaced people in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Activities include: distributing food assistance; providing nutrition support, such as supplementary and therapeutic feeding, for children under the age of five and for pregnant and lactating women; and providing support to help people earn a living through initiatives such as food-for-assets and food-for-training, whereby people receive food in exchange for working or participating in job training.",4.0,,2013-12-31,2013-09-20,2013-12-31,,,,,Canada,CA,Government,10.0,"Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada",CA-3,Government,10.0,WFP - World Food Programme ,41140,Multilateral,40.0,CD,"Congo, The Democratic Republic Of The",100,,,,72040,Emergency food aid,100,,1,1.0,110.0,,B03,,CAD,,1000000,1000000.00,0,0,0.0,0,0

Plan Sverige har inkommit med en ansökan om rambidrag på sammanlagt 452 000 000 kr för en 3,5-årsperiod som börjar i januari 2015 och fortsätter till 30 juni 2018. Anledningen till att avtalsperioden föreslås vara 3,5 år är att Sida har ställt sig positivt till att anpassa avtalsperioden och rapporteringsschemat till Plan Sveriges brutna räkenskapsår. Budgeten för verksamheten ligger på en högre nivå än tidigare år, och ett godkännande av den föreslagna budgetnivån skulle innebära en höjning av rambidraget med drygt 28 procent (från drygt 101 MSEK per år till 130 MSEK per år). Sida bedömer att ökningen är välplanerad och bygger på styrkorna i tidigare program. Ansökan är skriven i enlighet med instruktionen för stöd under Strategin för stöd genom det svenska civilsamhället. Sida bedömer att ansökan är komplett och att verksamheten är relevant i förhållande till strategin.

Ansökande organisation:
Plan Sverige är en del av den internationella barnrättsfederationen Plan International som har verksamhet och landkontor i över 50 länder i Afrika, Asien och Latinamerika. Plan Sverige grundades 1997 och är en av 21 nationella organisationer i Plan-federationen. Plan Sverige är en stiftelse (inte en medlemsorganisation). Däremot har organisationen ett starkt nätverk av faddrar som varje år bidrar med mer än 60 procent av organisationens budget. Medlen från fadderverksamheten ger Plan (både internationellt och i Sverige) en stabilitet som ger möjligheter att fastanställa personal oberoende av eventuell kortsiktighet hos givare, samt betala för budgetposter som tidvis är svåra att samla in medel till. Plan Sverige har varit ramorganisation sedan 2006 (förnyad ramstatus 2014) och Sidas samlade erfarenhet av ramsamarbetet är god. På senare år har organisationen även fått status som strategisk partner för Sidas humanitära enhet och ECHO-status för samarbete med EU i humanitära frågor. 

Plan Sverige har under de senaste åren stärkt sin personalstyrka, och närmare 20 personer är på olika sätt delaktiga i att hantera ramanslaget. Av dessa är sju regionsamordnare, fem tematiska rådgivare, en programekonom, en verksamhetscontroller på heltid (ny tjänst), chefer, samordnare av institutionella givare och administrativ personal.

Plan Sverige samarbetar med Plan Internationals landkontor för insatsen, och landkontoren fungerar både som vidareförmedlare till civilsamhällesorganisationer och som genomförare av delar av programmet. Beredningen av insatsen har i största möjliga mån försökt bedöma landkontorens kapacitet i båda dessa roller. 

Sida bedömer att Plan Sverige fortsatt är en relevant partner i ramsamabetet med kapacitet att hantera ramanslag från Sida.

Ansökan:
Ansökan för perioden 2015-2018 har till syfte att ""barn och ungdomar, tillsammans med civilsamhället, kräver sina rättigheter från ansvarstagare som aktivt engagerar sig för att respektera, skydda och uppfylla dessa rättigheter"" (fritt översatt). Verksamheten ska ske i 19 länder, fyra regionala initiativ samt ett globalt program för påverkansarbete och innovation. Plan Sveriges ansökan är i stort en fortsättning på den verksamhet som organisationen haft under de senaste fyra åren under två avtal: Ramavtalet och avtalet gällande regeringens satsning på barns och ungdomars rätt till hälsa och utbildning. Nuvarande ansökan har för första gången helt integrerat de två ansatserna, och har resulterat i fem tematiska resultatområden/program:

1. Barns och ungdomars rätt till skydd från våld
2. Barns och ungdomars rätt till sexuell och reproduktiv hälsa
3. Barns och ungdomars medborgarskap och samhällsstyrning
4. Barnrättsstyrning
5. Barns rättigheter i katastrofsituationer (riskförebyggande och motståndskraft)

Sida bedömer att programmet är väl sammansatt, bygger på Plan Sveriges och Plan Internationals styrkor och på väl beprövande metoder - tillsammans med en vilja att hitta innovativa sätt att nå ännu bättre resultat.

EEPSEA's structure consists of a Sponsors Group, a Program Committee of senior scholars and policymakers, and a small Secretariat in the Centre's Regional Office for Southeast and East Asia (ASRO).  Phase I provided 30 training awards and 22 research grants, in seven of the ten member countries. New elements in phase II included in-country courses in Vietnam, Lao PDR, and Cambodia and new research topics. This phase III project will see the introduction of more EEPSEA-managed courses in Asia and emphasis on economy-wide research. Specifically the project will finance research projects on economy and environment, focusing on the internalization of external costs; provide support for researchers through the provision of literature, resource persons, peer review, etc.; provide training to network members; and convey the results of EEPSEA research projects to policymakers in local, national, and regional fora.",4.0,,,2009-02-20,2010-04-01,University of Hanoi.

It is an expression of IDRC's commitment to improving Canadians' understanding of global development issues that affect Canada and lower-income countries, and to increasing the knowledge and skills to address them.

Since 1993, CP has contributed to activities and research related to global and emerging issues, and Canada's contribution to understanding and addressing them. The projects funded have contributed to honing North-South collaborative research skills, infusing Southern perspectives into Canadian approaches to global issues, and shedding light on the changing nature of global-local relations.

This year, for the first time, the small grants will be administered through a competitive online quarterly application process with standardized forms and allocation criteria. As in the past, collaboration across institution type, discipline and geographic boundaries will be given particular consideration.

GAVI began offering Injection Safety Support (INS) in mid-2001 to countries that wanted to introduce or increase the use of auto-disable (AD) syringes and safety boxes into their national immunisation programmes for vaccines not supported by GAVI. To date, 71 GAVI-eligible countries have received GAVIs injection safety support (INS), and by the end of 2009 when the INS window closed, 66 countries reported that they were supporting injection safety practices either through donor support or their own health ministry budgets.

Northern Uganda has suffered from the consequences of a civil war during two decades. The poverty rates in the area are double compared to the rest of the country and the food insecurity is severe. Now the situation has calmed down in the area and the peop
le have been able to return back to their homelands. The project aims to transform the attitudes towards agricultural production to more systematic and professional. The change in the attitudes would give rise to new kind of production that uses local reso
urces efficiently and sustainably to improve the food security and to increase the incomes of the households. This work makes good use of production groups, which purpose is to make development initiatives, promote the social integrity of the communities a
nd increase common activities. The agricultural production is made more effective by practical learning (Farmer Field Schools) and the approaches are environmentally friendly. Each group will get their own demonstration plot and it is expected that the gro
ups will use them for cultivating food and cash crops as well as for experimenting new species and production techniques. One of the project activities is the building of a water harvesting system. A committee is also administering and sustaining the water
 systems. The project includes the formation of Community draught resilient Committees, which are in charge of coordinating water supply use related community level questions. Women?s participation is especially taken into account in all project activities
. Beneficiaries, purpose and expected results of the project will be specified during the planning phase that precedes the project implementation phase. The project is implemented by ISF?s local partner organization Christian HIV and AIDS Prevention and Su

The overall objective of the Trust Fund is to provide a coherent and reinforced aid response to the Syrian crisis on a regional scale responding primarily in the first instance to the needs of refugees from Syria in neighbouring countries as well as of the
 communities hosting the refugees and their administrations in particular as regards resilience and early recovery. The Trust Fund will thus focus on current priority needs and may also be adapted to reconstruction needs in a future post-conflict scenario.
 Assistance inside Syria will be considered taking into account and avoiding overlap with the action of other existing international funding instruments and depend on agreement with the Syria Recovery Trust Fund which Finland is also funding.The fund has b
een established for five years and the Finnish support is proposed to be 3 MEUR which is also the threshold level for seat on the Operational Board. The initial size of the fund was 45 MEUR (Commission 37 Italy 3 and Germany 5).So far the Fund has financed
 three projects: 1) schooling in Turkey (175 MEUR), 2) regional higher education and training programme in Syria and its neighbors (12 MEUR), and 3) livelihoods of refugees and host communities in Jordan and Lebanon (10 MEUR). The decisions were made at th
e first Operational Board meeting on May 2015. The emphasize has been on children youth and anti-radicalization work which works well with Finnish priorities as well.Currently the project pipeline includes 520 MEUR worth of projects from the call for propo
sals on summer 2015. Biggest applicant groups were 1) large European INGOs, 2) UNICEF, 3) ICRC, 4) Member States? agencies, 5) UNRWA, and 6 ) IOM and UN-Habitat. Madad fund is supposed to work in tight strategic partnership with the UN but not channel the 
majority of its funding through UN agencies (roughly 30 %). The Trust Fund aims at funding larger interventions on which several NGOs pool their resources and funding thus aiming to achieve economies of scale.Syria and its neighboring states are ODA-eligib
le as middle-income (low or high) countries. Syria itself however is probably de facto among the least-developed countries by now.

We Effect har inkommit med en ansökan om rambidrag för åren 20182022 inom ramen för ""Strategin för stöd genom svenska organisationer i det civila samhället 2016-2022"". Ansökan är uppställd i enlighet med Sidas ""riktlinjer för ramorganisationer inom anslagsposten stöd genom svenska organisationer i det civila samhället"" (version 2.1 2017-06- 26). We Effect beviljades totalt ett belopp om 702 384 867 kr för ramstöd under perioden 2014-2017. Det totala ansökta beloppet för perioden 2018-2022 inklusive administrationsbidrag uppgår till 1 091 491 259 kr.

De huvudsakliga målen för perioden 2018-2022 är:
- År 2021 är We Effect Sveriges främsta aktör och pådrivare för jämställt bistånd inom hållbar landsbygd och värdigt boende.
- År 2021 har kvinnor (inom We Effects samarbetsorganisationer) samma rätt som män till ekonomiska resurser och möjlighet att äga och kontrollera mark.

De två övergripande målen som uppges ovan gäller för hela We Effects verksamhet och är inte specifika för rambidraget. För CSO-anslaget är det första målet gällande We Effects roll som aktör och pådrivare i Sverige inte relevant. Sida kommer således enbart att följa upp på det andra målet samt de övergripande målen som återfinns inom We Effects landprogram.

Ansökan bygger på prioriteringar i We Effects verksamhetsinriktning för 20182022 och utgår ifrån deras nya strategi ""Equality First."" We Effects ansökan är en fortsättning på det ramprogram som genomförts under pågående avtal 2014-2016 med tilläggsåret 2017. 

Den planerade insatsen omfattar 13 ""multi-country"" program som ska genomföras av fler än 200 samarbetsorganisationer i 25 länder. Det lokala civilsamhället är huvudaktörer i utvecklingsprojekten och driver den förväntade förändringen. We Effects resultatmodell har tydliga programmål samt identifierade indikatorer och riskanalyser. Varje program har en budget och specifika delmål som följs upp i relation till organisationens övegripande mål och budget. We Effects förändringsteori bygger på ett rättighetsperspektiv där rättighetsbärare är medvetna om sina rättigheter och har kapacitet att utkräva dem. 

En stor del av världens fattiga lever på landsbygden och försörjer sig på lantbruk. Inom ramen för den planerade insatsen kommer We Effect att ge stöd till småskaliga lantbrukare att utveckla sitt lantbruk i syfte att minska deras fattigdom. För att uppnå resultat i de kontexter där organisationen verkar samarbetar We Effect främst med medlemsbaserade bondeorganisationer, bostadskooperativ eller sparande och kreditgrupper eller kooperativ (SACCO) som arbetar med hållbar landsbygdsutveckling och värdigt boende. Även om inte alla partnerorganisationer är kooperativ är det enligt We Effect centralt att stödja den kooperativa modellen. Kooperativ utgör en viktig del av det civila samhället och i arbetet med att uppnå en hållbar utveckling. We Effect stödjer sina samarbetsorganisationer med rådgivning och utbildning, möjlighet att spara eller låna pengar och stöd med affärsutveckling. 

2. Ansökande organisation
We Effect (tidigare Kooperation utan gränser) bildades 1958 av den kooperativa rörelsens dominerande företag, Föreningsbanken och LRF. We Effect är en ideell, partipolitiskt och religiöst obunden organisation vars syfte är att stärka medlemsbaserade och demokratiska organisationers förmåga att göra det möjligt för fattiga kvinnor och män att förbättra sina levnadsvillkor, försvara sina rättigheter och bidra till ett rättvist samhälle. Bakom We Effect står ett sextiotal medlemsorganisationer från den svenska konsument- och producentkooperationen. 

We Effect arbetar för att förena demokrati, affärsutveckling och socialt ansvarstagande. Rätten till mark, finansiella tjänster, en hållbar miljö i ekologisk balans och lika rättigheter för kvinnor och män, flickor och pojkar ska genomsyra deras verksamhet. Målgruppen för We Effects utvecklingssamarbete är kvinnor och män som lever i fattigdom och som",2,,,2018-01-01,2023-10-28,WE EFFECT,,,,Sweden,SE-0,Government,10,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency,SE-6,Government,10,Donor country-based NGO,22000.0,National NGO,22.0,ZM,Zambia,100.0,,,,16040,Low-cost housing,100,,1,1.0,110.0,10.0,B03,5.0,USD,,173985.086992,173985.086992,0.0,0,0.0,0,0

The priority will be given for selecting of community infrastructures which can benefit the whole community members and alleviate the negative effect of potential drought. Potential infrastructure works may include irrigation canal construction or rehabilitation, karez cleaning, water saving technologies (rain water harvesting ponds).
The project will also provide emergency, unconditional cash for food of 18,000 AFN for 192 most vulnerable households who have no family member to work due disabilityand age issues.
Proposed response
Usually in case of drought (dry spell season), affected people, communities need of emergency, early recovery and longer-term support from Government and Aid agencies.  Oxfam is proposing to use 83,048 EUR from Oxfam Novib#s 2018-2019 discretionary funding to launch the emergency cash assistance in Daykundi. Oxfam#s local partner NGO, Afghan Development Association (ADA) has operational office in Daikundi. Supporting ADA for this emergency response is in line with the requirements of Oxfam Novib#s discretionary funding utilization and contributes to Grand Bargain commitment in localization of the aid. Considering FSAC members joint assessment report recommendations and funding limitation, this project will cover Ashterlay district of Daykundi province. Oxfam and ADA will continue to explore additional external funding opportunities for drought response. The activities proposed in the framework of this project include the following:
1. Vulnerability assessment and beneficiary selection
a. Communities selection
In consultation with provincial and district authorities, cluster of Community Development Councils (CDCs), ADA will identify up to 10 communities which are most vulnerable to the upcoming drought. Key criteria for communities# selection include: lack or limited availability of income generation opportunities, higher number of population versus limited available natural resources (land, water, pasture), degradation of natural resources, predominantly agriculture areas, no other similar projects in the community toavoid overlap. ADA will coordinate the target communities# selection with other International and local NGOs to avoid the overlap.
b. Household vulnerability assessment and beneficiary selection
Through consultation with selected communities CDCs, ADA will develop the preliminary list of vulnerable households. All CDC members will be explained by ADA about the vulnerability criteria (see below in the document) for beneficiary selection, project goals and planned activities. As a second step, ADA staff will conduct an independent assessment of households from the preliminary list. To avoid fraud cases in targeting of vulnerable households, ADA field team will be trained and guided by ADA Kabul office and Oxfam on beneficiary targeting principles, processes. ADA will use smart phones for data collection with Mobenzi software which will be funded by this project. ADA team will be trained by Oxfam on how to use the data collection tool. In consultation with FSAC, Oxfam decided to use SFSA household vulnerability assessment questionnaire. Seeannex 2 # Household assessment questionnaire.
Based on households# assessment database in Mobenzi, Oxfam and ADA will select the list of final beneficiaries using the selection criteria listed below in the document. Due to limited resources, the selection criteria will not be targeting people based on their status but based on their vulnerability which may include the following:
1. Female Headed Household;
2. Child Headed Household;
3. Disabled Headed Household;
4. Elderly Headed Household;
5. Households with children under 5 with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) or Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM);
6. Vulnerable Households with more than 3 children under five years old and/or pregnant women and/or lactating women;
7. Very Large Family (7 members or more);
8. Very Poor Families # household monthly income of no more than 5000 AFN;
9. Families with Chronically-ill members or having other pressing vulnerability;
10. Families with only one male members;
11. The families having high score in reduced Coping Strategy Index (rCSI) and low food consumption score (FCS).
Aiming to reduce the risks of fraud in beneficiary targeting, ADA Monitoring and Evaluation team will conduct pre-distribution monitoring by calling at least 10% of selected households. Furthermore, ADA will conduct awareness raising among all target communities, CDCs, beneficiaries about Oxfam#s beneficiary feedback and complaint mechanism. The project will aim to target as much as possible vulnerable female headed households and promote women#s participation. To achieve this, ADA will implement the project in a gender and culturally sensitive manner. ADA will have at least 50% female staff among all project staff members and provide training to all project staff in community, beneficiary targeting process, accountability, transparency, humanitarian principles, beneficiary protection and effective communication techniques.

2. Emergency cash assistance
Aiming to provide immediate income opportunity and rehabilitate the community infrastructures, the project will facilitate cash for work (CFW) activities. The priority will be given for selecting of community infrastructures which can benefit the whole community members and alleviatethe negative effect of potential drought. Potential infrastructure works may include irrigation canal construction or rehabilitation, karez cleaning, water saving technologies (rain water harvesting ponds). To increase the communities and beneficiaries# ownershipADA will encourage target communities to contribute with tools for CFW activities and use limited project funds for cash assistance. Aiming to ensure the quality of the community infrastructure works, ADA will employ one qualified engineer, who will train and work with target communities in site selection, BoQ (bill of quantities) development, planning and implementation of the CFW technical works. Through this project, Oxfam and ADA will provide 86 vulnerable households with conditional cash assistance of 18,000 AFN for their 36 days of work (average 500 AFN/day including 350 AFN unskilled and 650 AFN skilled labor).  The project will also provide emergency, unconditional cash for food of 18,000 AFN for 192 most vulnerable households who have no family member to work due disability and age issues. This 6000 AFN is based on the standard FSAC package of one-month food basket calculated for a household of average 7 members, providing 2,100 Kcal/person/day. Hence, 18,000 AFN will cover 3 months food needs as per FSAC recommendations. ADA willuse cash in envelope or local hawala for cash delivery mechanism considering the feasibility and risk assessment. Cash distributions will be made monthly. To avoid local market prices inflation, ADA will conduct weekly monitoring of prices for main food items in Nili, Ashterlay markets and will share the findings with Oxfam. Based on FSAC data, at this stage the assumption is that the local markets continue to function well with stable prices mainly due to supplies from major markets (Ghazni, Kabul and Kandahar markets).

Koudijs Animal Nutrition is also co-owner / investor of KDS. KDS now wants to expand its current activities and invest in a sustainable, innovative and fully integrated poultry farm (with attention for all links of the poultry chain: hatchery, parent stock, mother animals, animal feed, slaughterhouse, training center) and thereby professionalize the local poultry sector.

KDS wants to become the hub of the West African region for animal feed distribution and one day of chicks. For this she wants to set up a hatchery and a parent farm, starting with a capacity of 60,000 1 day chicks per week. KDS also wants to expand its animal feed production from 1 production location to 5 production sites with attention for safe animal feed. These animal feed factories will be located on some of the existing distribution outlets (12) of KDS that are scattered across the country. From here, farmers will also be provided with support and advice services. In addition, KDS intends to invest in a first poultry slaughterhouse and meat processing facility in collaboration with the government, with attention for safe food (including for Carefour and Unilever). And finally, she wants to set up a small demonstration and training farm that will be based on the KIPSTER farm concept that focuses on animal welfare and the environment.

Since KDS has limited knowledge in the field of hatchery, slaughterhouse, animal welfare, stalk techniques and feed factories, it would like to cooperate with Hatchcon and five other Dutch consortium partners. They are able to examine the complete plan of KDS on technical and commercial feasibility. KDS intends to implement this project within 3 to 5 years",2,2017-08-01,2018-07-31,2017-08-01,,Netherlands Enterprise Agency,NL-KVK-27378529,Government,10,Netherlands Enterprise Agency,NL-KVK-27378529,Government,10,,,,,Kipster BV,NL-KVK-60506490,Private Sector,70,,,,,,,32161,Agro-industries,100,,1,,110.0,,,,EUR,EUR,65816.0,59234.00,0,65816.00,0.0,0,0.0

However, changes in the structure of economic (and political) governance have not proceeded apace, leaving the economy exposed to external shocks. These institutional and governance questions will have to be addressed if Viet Nam is to reach its goal of becoming a middle-income country by the year 2010.

VERN I (101273) constituted the first network for young economic researchers in Viet Nam, where previously there had been no modality for cooperation or peer review. Guided by the philosophy of ""understanding and managing globalization"" that underpinned the earlier project, VERN II proposes to expand the network, enhance the analytical skills of its constituents, raise the quality of work to international standards, strengthen the network's links with the university community and increase the application of economic research to development policy in Viet Nam. The project will also attempt to establish research linkages to better position Viet Nam in the Greater Mekong subregion.

One way to achieve this is by supporting international events that pursue the same objective, and helping IDRC grant recipients attend those events. 

This project will provide sponsorship support for NCDP grant recipients to participate in international conferences. IDRC will offer priority status to those who have an abstract accepted for an oral presentation or a scientific poster. The funding will also be used to give profile to IDRC and the NCDP program, explore partnership development, and consult experts and partners on program strategy and research priorities.

NCDP has developed a list of meetings and conferences that will engage NCD prevention researchers and serve as platforms for exchanging new knowledge. The program team will organize a meeting to engage experienced researchers and strategists on the need for research to inform policy on active transport/non-motorized transport.

Insatsen har som övergripande mål att stärka utvecklingsländers kapacitet att reglera/övervaka den finansiella sektorn i riktning mot stabila och inkluderande marknader.

Toronto Centre (TC) är en oberoende icke-vinstdrivande organisation som grundades 1998 av dåvarande kanadensiska CIDA, Världsbanken och Schulich School of International Business som ett direkt svar på den asiatiska krisen som tydligt visade att ekonomiska framsteg och minskad fattigdom riskerar kraftiga bakslag ifall en ekonomisk kris bryter ut. IMF och Sida (sedan 2008) har anslutit som finansiärer och verksamheten är inne i en stark expansionsfas med stor efterfrågan på centrets tjänster.

TC erbjuder olika program i samarbete med mottagarländernas regler- eller övervakningsinstitutioner (typ Finansinspektion eller Centralbank) som kan vara veckolånga eller återkommande över en 4-årsperiod till vissa länder. Områdena som täcks utgörs av banking, försäkring, värdepapper, pensioner, mikrofinans och mikroförsäkring.

TCs ursprungliga ansökan låg på MSEK 13,8 per år men har reducerats ner till MSEK 9, främst beroende på Sidas neddragna anslag. Det nu aktuella beloppet innebär ändå en höjning vilket speglar det faktum att verksamheten, enligt flera oberoende utvärderingar, bedrivs framgångsrikt och effektivt. CIDA (numera GAC) är största finansiär. Under 2015 deltog sammanlagt 1 300 personer i 66 olika program.

Den nu aktuella avtalsperioden baseras på fyra strategiska mål:
* Expandera verksamheten och erbjuda fler program
* Utöka andelen fleråriga program
* Fördjupa uppföljningen med deltagarna genom post-program aktiviteter och on-line resurscenter
* Kontinuerligt följa upp och sträva efter ökad kvalitet, bl a via Program Quality Task Force

Sida har tidigare framgångsrikt drivit frågan om jämställdhet och kommer även göra det framgent inklusive miljö/klimat.",2,,,2016-06-01,2020-06-28,TORONTO LEADERSHIP CENTRE,,,,Sweden,SE-0,Government,10,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency,SE-6,Government,10,INTERNATIONAL NGO,21000.0,International NGO,21.0,,,,998.0,"Developing countries, unspecified",100.0,24081,Education/training in banking and financial services,100,,1,3.0,110.0,10.0,B01,5.0,USD,,2103663.881259,1035625.5178120001,0.0,0,0.0,0,0

Inequal distribution of health and illness caused by poverty is a major global problem. It has been considered as a key issue in the UN Millennium Development Goals and it appears that it will remain central after 2015 for the Sustainable Development Goals
. Global Health (GH) training will provide students with knowledge base to work on global health issues in cross-sectoral collaboration efforts. The ultimate aim of the project is poverty reduction.Good health status of population's is a prerequisite of de
mocratic development of societies and also an indicator of a health promoting environment. GH training is based on the recognition of social determinants of health as the basic cause for health inequalities. The curricula puts emphasis on health promotion 
of women children and vulnerable groups. A cross-cutting theme during the learning sessions will be climate change and related problems which also health professionals need to tackle according to the principles of sustainable development. Thus beneficiarie
s of the GH project will be all vulnerable groups because in the end the increased knowledge level of health professionals will lead to diminishing health inequalities.The key activities of the project will be Global Health courses to health professionals 
in Nepal the Philippines and Tanzania. We will additionally produce teaching materials on the Internet and organize in Finland training for GH faculty members coming from all the Partner countries. During the three year project period we will set up a high
 level summit on a topical issues targeted for the general public and decision makers. As part of advocacy activities there will be a seminar in Finland for health professionals and NGO sector which discusses timely GH issues.This will be the exit phase of
 the GH project. The aims of this project period is to strengthen the skills and competencies in the Partner country universities in a way which allows GH themes to be incorporated into their structures and teaching curricula.

APCs förändringsteori bottnar i åskådningen att internet och annan ICT har potential att stärka civila och politiska rättigheter, men att det parallellt med dessa möjligheter finns centrala utmaningar. Dessa är:
-	Brist på tillgång till ICT, särskilt för marginaliserade grupper.
-	Hot mot internets öppenhet och mänskliga rättigheter online, något som i synnerhet resulterar i ökade risker och minskad tillgång till rättigheter för kvinnor.
-	Hot mot kvinnor som är människorättsförsvarare och som använder internet som verktyg för förändring. 
-	Bristande kapacitet hos civilsamhället att använda internet och ICT på ett säkert och effektivt sätt.
-	Svårigheter för det Sydbaserade civilsamhället att delta i, och påverka, internets förvaltnings- och policyprocesser. 

För att möta dessa utmaningar har APC identifierat fem resultatområden. Samtliga resultatområden har korresponderande strategier för påverkansarbete, kapacitetsuppbyggnad, nätverkande och forskning. För detta har APC ett resultatramverk som inkluderar mål, utfall och indikatorer.
Insatsens fyra resultatområden är:
-	Säkerställa och försvara tillgång till internet och rättigheter online, och därmed även offline. 
-	God förvaltning av internet.
-	Stark egenmakt hos civilsamhället att använda ICT på ett säkert, effektivt och hållbart sätt. 
-	Möjliggöra för kvinnorättsorganisationer att forma internets policys, användning och utveckling.
-	Upprätthålla APC som en stark organisation och nätverk. 

Ansökan är en fortsättning på det pågående tvååriga kärnstödet som initierades i slutet oktober 2013 och vars aktivitetsperiod sträcker sig till 31 december 2015. Det tidigare stödets storlek var i genomsnitt MSEK 9.3 per 12-månadersperiod, medan det planerade stödet är 11-15 MSEK/år. Detta innebär en budgetökning i SEK, men motsvarar under de två första åren en bibehållen nivå av stöd i USD, vilken är den valuta som APCs implementering styrs av. Ansökan är till stora delar en fortsättning på det pågående stödet, med förändringen att ansökan i större utsträckning inkluderar vidareförmedling. Det är också bakgrunden till ökningen i stödet. Bland APCs övriga givare återfinns till exempel Europeiska Unionen, FORD, International Development Research Centre (IDRC) och the Sigrid Rausing Trust.",2,,,2016-01-01,2020-12-28,APC/ASSOCIATION FOR PROGR.

Med sitt mandat att skydda flyktingar, tvångsfördrivna och statslösa, se till dessas möjlighet att återvända, vidarebosättas eller integreras i sina värdsamhällen, så är UNHCR, tillsammans med ICRC, Sidas viktigaste partner inom skyddsområdet. Utöver sin operativa roll i skyddet av flyktingar (juridisk hjälp, utfärda identitetshandlingar, asylrätt, etc) har UNHCR en normativ roll i övervakning och tolkning av flyktingkonventionen. UNHCR är inom humanitära systemet huvudaktören i alla flyktingkriser, med övergripande koordineringsansvar av FN- och civilsamhällsorganisationers humanitära arbete samt ansvarar för samarbete med nationella och lokala myndigheter. I dagsläget omfattar detta koordinering av flera regionala flyktingappeller så som Syrien, Afrikas horn, Nigeria, Sydsudan, Jemen, Centralafrikanska republiken, Burundi och i Europa.

I humanitära kriser inom ett lands gränser ansvarar ""United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)"" för koordineringen av den humanitära responsen, detta gäller även internflyktingkriser (Internally displaced People crisis). UNHCR ansvarar i dessa kriser för att leda och samordna arbetet i tre kluster (sektoriella koordineringsgrupper); skyddsklustret, klustret för Camp Coordination and Camp Management, samt Emergency Shelter klustret. UNHCR bidrar därmed till det humanitära systemet globalt, regionalt och nationellt. Utöver detta, och när situationen tillåter, arbetar UNHCR också för hållbara lösningar för flyktingar.

Genom sitt stöd till UNHCR 2018 bidrar Sida till att bistå flyktingar och internflyktingar så att dessa får skydd mot förföljelse och våld, tak över huvudet och basförnödenheter (mat, vatten, hygien, primärsjukvård, etc.) Vidare bidrar Sida till strategisk samordning inom det humanitära systemet. 

Sidas finansiella bidrag till UNHCR 2018 omfattar totalt 235 MSEK till följande kriser:
Demokratiska Republiken Kongo 20 MSEK, Etiopien 10 MSEK, Irak 14 MSEK, Jemen 20 MSEK, Myanmarkrisen verksamhet i Bangladesh 5 MSEK, Mali 7 MSEK, Somaliakrisen verksamhet i Somalia 5 MSEK, Somaliakrisen verksamhet i Kenya 5 MSEK, Sudan 5 MSEK, Sydsudankrisen verksamhet regionalt 28 MSEK, Syrienkrisen verksamhet i Syrien 25 MSEK, Syrienkrisen verksamhet regionalt 30 MSEK, Ukraina 10 MSEK, Algeriet 5 MSEK, Burundikrisen verksamhet i Burundi 6 MSEK, Burundikrisen verksamhet regionalt 10 MSEK, Libyen 5 MSEK, skydds- och förebyggande arbete emot sexuellt genderbaserat våld 5 MSEK, samt oöronmärkt stöd (för fördelning under året) 20 MSEK. Dessa icke-öronmärkta medel, om 20 MSEK, regleras genom avtalet som fastställer att UNHCR ska inkomma med kompletterande underlag som skriftligen ska godkännas av Sida inför att medlen behövs nyttjas av UNHCR. Medlen möjliggör för UNHCR att snabbt kunna respondera till plötsligt uppkomna eller drastiskt eskalerande kriser.

Sida beslutar om detta stöd, som komplement till regeringens årliga kärnbidrag. Sidas stöd går till FNs konsoliderade humanitära appeller (Humanitarian Response Plans), UNHCRs Globala appell och UNHCRs tilläggsbudgetar (Supplementary Appeals) samt Regionala flyktingappeller (Regional Refugee Response Plans). Sida öronmärker genom avtal bidraget till UNHCR på land/region nivå men stödet är oöronmärkt inom denna nivå. Sida har under året även möjlighet att ta ställning till ytterligare stöd genom tilläggsbeslut.

Sida bedömer att samtliga medel för 2018 ska utbetalas i början av året för att UNHCR ska ges förutsättningar att planera och genomföra humanitära insatser utan fördröjning. UNHCR omsätter regelmässigt utbetalda medel i nära anslutning till utbetalning och förbrukar gåvomedel inom verksamhetsåret. Den föreslagna betalningsplanen överensstämmer således med Sidas insatshanteringsregel, avsnitt 2.8.4, där det föreskrivs att betalningen kommer att ske i nära anslutning t",2,,,2013-01-01,2019-12-28,UNHCR/UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMM,,,,Sweden,SE-0,Government,10,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency,SE-6,Government,10,United Nations Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,41121.0,Multilateral,40.0,UA,Ukraine,100.0,,,,72010,Material relief assistance and services,100,,1,1.0,110.0,10.0,B03,5.0,USD,,4253469.876558,3264034.7459340002,0.0,0,0.0,0,0

UNICEF also works to ensure that children are protected from violence and abuse and receive relief in disasters. Canada's support to UNICEF helps to advance Canadas Feminist International Assistance Policy, which will help the poorest and most vulnerable, support fragile states and underpin Canadas international efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.",2.0,,2021-12-31,2018-12-11,,,,,,Canada,CA,Government,10.0,"Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada",CA-3,Government,10.0,UNICEF - United Nations Children's Fund ,41122,Multilateral,40.0,,,,89;889;798;498;298,"Europe, regional;Oceania, regional;Asia, regional;America, regional;Africa, regional",5;5;20;20;50,11110;11130;11220;11231;11240;11320;11330;12110;12220;12240;12250;12261;12262;12263;13040;14031;14032;15130;15150;15160;15180;15261;72010;72040;72050;73010;74010,Education policy and administrative management;Teacher training;Primary education;;Early childhood education;Secondary education;Vocational training;Health policy and administrative management;Basic health care;Basic nutrition;Infectious disease control;Health education;Malaria control;Tuberculosis control;STD control including HIV/AIDS;Basic drinking water supply;Basic sanitation;Legal and judicial development;Democratic participation and civil society;;;Child soldiers (Prevention and demobilisation);Material relief assistance and services;Emergency food aid;Relief co-ordination; protection and support services;Reconstruction relief and rehabilitation;Disaster prevention and preparedness,2;1;2;1;1;2;1;2;7;7;4;2;1;1;1;5;5;3;3;6;5;3;10;10;5;5;5,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1,2.0,110.0,,B02,,CAD,,64800000,32400000.00,0,0,0.0,0,0

The partners concentrate on a selected number of countries in Africa: Benin, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Uganda and Zimbabwe. In Mali, the partners jointly contribute to four specific goals: i. To improve the enabling environment for effective policy influencing, by creating a level playing field for all political actors and civic actors wanting to influence politics. ii. To strengthen the policy influencing capacities and responsiveness of political parties, parliaments, MPs and civil society actors. iii. Increasing general interest in consulting and collaborating among and between political and civic actors. iv. Strengthening the voice and position of women and youth in the consultation processes. The departing point for the Strategic Partnership in Mali is a joint NIMD-AWEPA Theory of Change and Baseline. The country programme is embedded in strong local political networks, underpinned by a deep rooted knowledge of the local political economy and a solid institutional infrastructure for programme implementation. To acknowledge the importance of cross-border themes and regional interdependencies that increasingly shape national policy agendas and to stimulate peer learning and exchange, dedicated strategies and instruments for peer learning, knowledge and innovation and PME have been developed as part of the strategic partnership. Furthermore, to maximize opportunities for regional and international lobby and advocacy on issues that emanate from national policy agendas, the programme foresees in the development of dedicated strategies for potential upstream policy influencing at regional and global fora and bodies.",2.0,,2020-12-31,2016-01-01,,AWEPA,NL-KVK-34106722,International NGO,21.0,AWEPA,NL-KVK-34106722,International NGO,21.0,,,,,AWEPA,NL-KVK-34106722,International NGO,21.0,ML,Mali,100,,,,15152,Legislatures and political parties,100,,1,1.0,110.0,10.0,C01,5.0,EUR,!Mixed currency,0,0,!Mixed currency,0,0.0,0,0

Planteada como un complejo de propuestas diversas, la Biblioteca Universitaria constituye su principal actividad, por su espacio, ubicación geográfica, ambiente de recogimiento que ayuda al estudio y su apoyo bibliográfico. Además posibilita la celebración de diversos actos culturales y sociales, tanto durante el curso lectivo como durante el verano. Esta misma razón impulsó acondicionar el salón grande para multiusos, sobre todo proyecciones de cine, talleres, matinales?Las aulas educativas se ubicaron en la planta alta del crucero y acogen a un profesorado multiétnico. Es decir, el Centro se proyecta como una realidad intercultural, pues participan estudiantes y colaboradores de diferentes nacionalidades, así como un equipo de dirección también internacional. Su objeto es la promoción de los jóvenes de esta región de Marruecos, a través de iniciativas formativas e informativas, de apoyo al estudio o la investigación, el incentivo a la creatividad, el asociacionismo civil, el diálogo o el encuentro y dando oportunidades laborales a licenciados en paro que se hacen cargo de los diferentes cursos de lenguas. La filosofía del Centro se rige por lo valores humanistas de la responsabilidad, esfuerzo personal, el servicio y compromiso con los demás y el trabajo comunitario. Nuestra Biblioteca se concibió en un principio como apoyo a la comunidad universitaria de las Facultades de Letras ubicadas en Martil. Desde hace dos años se han incorporado nuevas licenciaturas a la sede de Martil de la Universidad Abdelmalek Essaadi, en concreto la Facultad Polidisciplinar imparte las licenciaturas de Derecho, Económicas, Psicología y Sociología, Ello ha traído consigo un cambio de perfil del universitario que estudia en Martil, pues se ha diversificado enormemente la procedencia de los mismos ?de otras regiones de Marruecos-. Muchos de los nuevos estudiantes que acuden a la Biblioteca o piensan utilizar nuestros servicios demandan libros en dichas nuevas especialidades, demanda que no podemos satisfacer al no disponer de dichos fondos. Se precisaría incorporar libros, en las materias de literatura árabe, filología inglesa y francesa, economía, derecho, historia, informática y estudios islámicos, en lengua árabe y francés. Mucho Licenciados se incorporan a nuestro equipo de profesores y colaboradores, pero adolecen de la debida formación, más si cabe en la atención a la biblioteca y sus numerosos usuarios. Por ello se precisa la formación suficiente y necesaria en las materias propias de la Biblioteca: biblioteconomía y archivística, técnica",3.0,2011-10-17,2013-01-17,,,MAEC - Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores y de Cooperación,AC-1,,,Spain,,Government,10.0,AECID - Agencia Española de Cooperación Internacional al Desarrollo,AC2-1,,,Otra entidad sin ánimo de lucro del país socio,AC-184,,,MA,Morocco,100,189,"North of Sahara, regional",,16061,Culture and recreation,,,1,1.0,,10.0,C01,5.0,,EUR,22000,22000,0,0,0.0,0.0,0

Training awards programs are now offered by COPEHs in West and Central Africa (Université du Bénin), Latin America and the Caribbean (Instituto de Salud Pública de Mexico), and East and Southern Africa (University of Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa). Researchers in key academic institutions have identified a need to consolidate efforts to build excellence and develop capacity in Ecohealth research. This grant will support the creation of a Canadian Community of Practice in Ecohealth (COPEH-Can) to promote and support Ecohealth research, education, policy and practice. COPEH-Can will be built progressively on a regional consortium of institutions that have demonstrated their interest in Ecohealth and have a strong record of collaborating with developing country scientists, mainly: the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), the University of Guelph and the University of British Columbia (UBC). Over the next three years (2008-2010), each university will establish a regional node (Quebec/Maritimes, Ontario and BC/Prairies/Territories, respectively), and design and accredit a short graduate-level course in Ecohealth for students and professionals interested in international and development applications. The project will provide a pan-Canadian platform to deliver and manage up to five Canadian Ecohealth graduate awards per year.

Dessa problem visar vikten av mänsklig förståelse för de sociala och ekologiska relationer och processer de är en del av. Trots detta vilar nuvarande policyverktyg ofta på hypotesen att människor styr över passiva ekosystem. Men för att förstå miljöförändringar, och särskilt klimatpåverkan, är det nödvändigt att tänka på människan som förankrad i dessa relationer och processer. I sammanhang relaterade till utvecklingsländer är det viktigt att ta hänsyn till hur klimatförändringar är knutna till ett flertal ekonomiska och politiska utmaningar och konflikter för att främja utveckling och hållbarhet.Syftet med det här projektet är att inkorporera relationella och processorienterade perspektiv som en viktig bas för att utforska de hinder som fattiga kustsamhällen står inför i strävan mot hållbarhet genom resursstyrning och välbefinnande. Utöver detta kommer relationsperspektivet hjälpa oss att identifiera möjligheter till gemensamma åtgärder som samhällen kan uppnå genom sina nätverk. Vi kommer att utforska dessa problem genom att utveckla forumsteater med lokalbefolkning i utvalda samhällen i Kenya och Moçambique. Projektet fokuserar på kustsamhällen i dessa länder som system där de sociala och ekologiska egenskaperna är djupt sammanflätade. Kustsamhällen är särskilt viktiga social-ekologiska system, där exempelvis fiske som grundläggande försörjning för miljontals människor runt om i världen har en mycket bättre position för att säkerställa en hållbar förvaltning av hav än industrifiske. Kustsamhällena präglas dock ofta av fattigdom, brist på politiskt inflytande för att få sina behov uppmärksammade och stor risk för klimatpåverkan. I detta projekt bygger vi på aktuell forskning kring dessa samhällen, där det framgår att beslutsprocesser inom fiske bättre förstås som en del av social-ekologiska nätverk. Genom detta projekt bygger vi på aktuell forskning kring dessa samhällen och på forskningsfronten för social-ekologiska system som en uppsättning relationer och processer som för samman sociala och ekologiska värden. Kustsamhällen  kan beskrivas konceptuellt som ett nätverk som för samman fiskarna, deras samhällen, försäljningsaktiviteter, redskap, fisk, båtar etc. Var och en av komponenterna i detta nätverk spelar en nödvändig roll för att upprätthålla samhället och utforska utvecklingsalternativ. Därför måste vi också dra slutsatsen att förändringar i nätverket påverkar kustsamhällena. För att testa relevansen av att konceptuellt beskriva social-ekologiska system på relationella sätt och utvärdera i vilken utsträckning de kan identifiera konflikter och främja stärkande handlingar kommer vi att utveckla samhällsteaterföreställningar, som bygger på kompetens hos projektdeltagare och kollegor. Vi kommer att utveckla föreställningarna tillsammans med lokala artister och samhällen för att försöka använda akademisk kunskap om de utvecklings- och hållbarhetsutmaningar som dessa samhällen möter. Detta bidrar till samhällenas egna reflektioner av sina erfarenheter relaterat till dessa utmaningar. Vi kommer använda metaforiskt tänkande för att (i) bättre förstå hur hindren för hållbar utveckling är djupt sammanflätade i social-ekologiska nätverk, och (ii) att förbättra en relationell uppfattning om social-ekologiskt handlande som ger samhällen ett reflexivt utrymme för att undersöka möjligheter för anpassning till klimatförändringar. Föreställningarna kommer vidare att representeras i flera samhällen genom forumteater, vilket är en slags teater där publiken kan delta och föreslår sätt att hantera de problem som representeras i föreställningen. Därefter kommer vi att efteranalysera dessa föreställningar i fokusgrupper med deltagare. Beslutsfattare, inklusive offentliga tjänstemän från lokal och nationell nivå, kommer att bjudas in till att delta från projektets början av två orsaker.

TTI-funded institutions had expressed the need for this funding in order to promote collaboration, learning, and innovation.

About the Opportunity Fund
In December 2013, TTI launched a call for proposals for the end of the Phase 1 Opportunity Fund. This fund supports TTI grantee organizations' efforts to achieve their long-term objectives. These are projects that cannot otherwise be carried out through use of TTI core funding. 

The purpose of the Opportunity Fund is to provide supplementary funding for activities that are not already budgeted for in the organizations' TTI work plans for 2013-2014. To be eligible for support, applicant TTI grantees will allocate and fully spend all their Phase 1 core funding by September 30, 2014.

Several TTI grantee institutions submitted research support proposals in response to the Opportunity Fund call. Selected proposals came from the following institutions:
-Fundación Dr Guillermo Manuel Ungo, El Salvador
-Fundación INESAD, Bolivia
-Foro Social de la Deuda Externa de Honduras, Honduras
-Instituto de Estudios Peruanos, Peru
-Fundación ""ARU"", Bolivia
-Fundación Salvadoreña para el Desarrollo Económico y Social, El Salvador

These proposals fulfill the call's requirements and comprise a variety of activities that will provide institutional support and foster collaboration among think tanks. 

The proposed activities include publications, capacity-building consultancies, and efforts to consolidate academic networks. In all cases, the activities align with each institution's objectives as listed in their TTI core funding grant agreements.",4.0,,,2014-03-01,2014-09-01,Fundación Doctor Guillermo Manuel Ungo,,Regional NGO,23.0,Netherlands.

ANSÖKANDE ORGANISATION
SMR är en svensk ideell förening och paraplyorganisation för 35 svenska samfund, missionsorganisationer och kristna biståndsorganisationer. Det är på dessa medlemsorganisationers uppdrag som SMR är avtalspart med Sida. SMR har varit ramorganisation under CSO-anslaget sedan 1980 och 2014-04-11 fattade Sida beslut om organisationens fortsatta ramstatus. SMR är en vidareförmedlande organisation, vilket innebär att en stor del av Sida-stödet förmedlas vidare till medlemsorganisationerna för deras utvecklingssamarbete. Utvecklingssamarbetet genomförs genom samarbetsorganisationer i utvecklingsländer inom olika tematiska och geografiska områden. Följande 17 av SMR:s medlemsorganisationer genomför och får stöd för utvecklingssamarbete under SMR:s övergripande ledning och ansvar:

ADRA Sverige
Evangeliska Frikyrkan
Erikshjälpen
Folk & Språk
International Aid Services (IAS) Sverige
KFUM Sverige
Kristna Fredsrörelsen
Vännernas samfund/Kväkarna
Lepramissionen
Life & Peace Institute
Operation Mercy
Svenska Alliansmissionen
Svenska Baptistsamfundet
Skandinaviska Barnmissionen
Svenska Bibelsällskapet
Equmeniakyrkan
Läkarmissionen (ny 2016)


ANSÖKAN
Ansökan avser en fortsättning på verksamheten under den pågående avtalsperioden 2013-2015. I enlighet med riktlinjerna för CSO-anslaget utgår ansökan 2016 från ansökan för 2013-2015 och fokuserar på förändringar och nyheter. Merparten av de policyer som legat till grund för verksamheten under 2013-2015 används och ligger fast även för 2016. En ny policy som tillkommit är dock policyn för rättighetsperspektivet som SMR antog under 2014. En medlemsorganisation, Individuell Människohjälp (IM), har lämnat SMR och en ny, Läkarmissionen, har tillkommit som medlem och bidragsmottagare. IM är nu ramorganisation och har ett avtal direkt med Sida. En nyhet i ansökan är också att SMR föreslår en pott för insatser med fokus på Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). Fokus för verksamheten under 2016 kommer annars att vara att fullfölja, avsluta och utvärdera den verksamhet som pågått under 2013-2015 samt att planera verksamheten för den kommande femårsperioden 2017-2021. SMR avser att inkomma med en femårsansökan för denna period. I ansökan ingår totalt 60 insatser som genomförs i 50 länder av totalt 17 medlemsorganisationer och deras ca 129 samarbetsorganisationer. Insatserna varierar i storlek och komplexitet. Vissa är enstaka projekt med en partner i ett land medan andra är större program som genomförs i flera länder och med flera partner. 

I ansökan lyfter SMR specifikt hur de ligger till i relation till de dialogfrågor som följs upp i rapportering och dialog inom ramen för det pågående avtalet mellan Sida och SMR. Dessa frågor är 1) Vidareutveckling av rättighetsbaserat arbete, 2) Påverkansarbete på central/nationell nivå, 3) Hur miljöfrågor beaktas i verksamheten, 4) Hur utvärdering används strategiskt i verksamheten och 5) Arbete med tvärfrågor och baslinjer i relation till resultatmodellen. En ytterligare fråga som tillkommit är frågan om hur känsliga värderingsfrågor som t.ex. HBTQ och abort hanteras inom ramen för utvecklingssamarbetet. Dessa frågor har följts upp i beredningen. 

Sida bedömer att ansökan är väl sammansatt och att den ger en god bild av verksamheten. Sida har dock begärt in några kompletteringar, framför allt avseende förtydliganden av budgeten. Inför nästa ansökan bör Sida och SMR diskutera hur SMR kan ge ett tydligare underlag för Sidas budgetbedömning. Detsamma gäller resultatmatrisen som också skulle kunna vara tydligare presenterad. 


BUDGET I ANSÖKAN

The funding demonstrates IDRC's commitment to improving Canadians' understanding of global development issues that affect Canada and lower-income countries. It will help increase the knowledge and skills needed to address these issues.

The project's objectives include:
-to support Canadian institutions to undertake innovative research and knowledge-based activities;
-to strengthen capacity among Canadian institutions to potentially help inform policy and practice in Canada and in low- and middle-income countries;
-to foster collaboration across types of organizations, areas of knowledge, and geographic boundaries;
-to encourage learning activities, including: self-monitoring and assessment of activities, knowledge-sharing; and learning from others' experiences; and,
-to respond to requests from IDRC programs and regional offices to support activities involving Canadian organizations.

Through these small grants, IDRC will support Canadians interested in innovative research and knowledge-led work for international development in areas that complement and may go beyond its current thematic priorities. The activities will contribute to:
-improving collaborative research skills;
-infusing perspectives from lower-income countries into Canadian approaches to global issues; and, 
-shedding light on the changing nature of global-local relations. 

This marks the third year that the small grants will be administered through a regular competitive application process.",3.0,,,2013-07-01,2015-06-30,Bay of Fundy Marine Resource Centre Association,,National NGO,22.0,Canada.

The main objective of this project is:
Young Dutch farmers support rural youth in developing countries in defending their interests, lobbying and in becoming rural entrepreneurs.

The secondary objective is:
Involve more Dutch young farmers in international cooperation.

Subgoals
	Motivate and help young farmers to set up their own Young Farmers Branch
	Support and advise on the design of youth policy
o	Training (the leadership and management skills) of young board members
o	Exchange experiences in how to organize and manage a farmers association 
o	Assist in lobby trainings and stay involved in lobby roadmap 
	Share knowledge on agricultural and marketing skills with individual young farmers
	Make sure the interests of rural youth from developing countries are taken into account at the (international) political advocacy 
o	Select and train NAJK-members involved in Agriterra assignments in intercultural communication and brainstorm methods
	Communicate Agriterra activities to Dutch young farmers in order to increase involvement.

Entrepreneurship
NAJK has members who are farmers in all kinds of different sectors; from animal production, milk production to horticulture. Most of them are involved in cooperatives or have alternative ways of selling their products. Becoming a farmer in the Netherlands is not an easy choice; farm installation is an expensive and long process. Most young people taking over a farm take this decision for life. It is their wish to be independent, to be an entrepreneur and to make a living out of their business. They are often eager to learn and have spend time at other farms (abroad). Most of them are far better educated than their parents. 

This drive to be an entrepreneur, their skills and their eagerness to learn can serve as an example for young people in developing countries. As in the Netherlands, rural work often has low status in these countries. Inspired by young Dutch farmers they can turn themselves into entrepreneurs as well. Dutch agro technical knowledge can serve in their education.   

Advocacy
NAJK as an organization has acquired a lot of knowledge over the years about business acquisition, advocacy, working with youth and managing projects . Board members speak regularly to EU-politicians in Brussels, national politicians like the Minister of Agriculture and local government bodies.  Over the years NAJK has build a large network of business companies, cooperatives, civil society and politics. NAJK is a respected partner for business and government where it concerns the interests of young farmers. Because NAJK is an organization for young people, board members cannot be older than 35 years and cannot be part of the board for longer than four years. NAJK is a breeding place for ambitious young people who would like to gain experience in governing and lobbying. Trainers and coaches make sure they acquire the right skills. As an organization NAJK has a clear vision, mission, a solid administration and professional staff members. NAJK feels dedicated to young farmers in less favorable conditions in developing countries. Organization building, lobbying and advocacy are activities in which NAJK can support young farmers in developing countries with .

Activities
a. A preparatory training weekend is organized for a maximum of fifteen NAJK-members that will be very likely to be assigned to facilitate a training / advisory assignment. This training is organized by the Institute of Cultural Affairs and involves:&#61692;	Intercultural Communication
&#61692;	Group Facilitation Methods (including the Focused Conversation Method and the Consensus Workshop Method)
b. A training for NAJK members having been assigned to missions and likely to be employed by Agriterra again. This training will be more in-depth and deal with the specific experiences of the Agripoolers . 
c. The farmers organizations in developing countries formulate their needs for training/advice and make a profile of the young farmers needing/participating the advice/training. This list including the profiles should be prepared as early as possible in order to prepare the assignment well. When already familiar with the organization, NAJK can make suggestions for the selection of participants.  
d. NAJK nominates candidates that are considered most suited for the assignment.
e. The selected candidate will be appointed to a NAJK-trainer/employee who will help to prepare the assignment in more detail. An NAJK-employee will help writing the report if necessary . 
f. In case of a visit to the Netherlands, a Terms of Reference including profiles of participants is delivered to NAJK as early as possible. NAJK-employees will be responsible for formulating and hosting a program . Young farmers, board members and trainers will be involved when suited.
g. NAJK will organize a debriefing involving the assignee, Agriterra and NAJK. This will provide a view of occurred bottlenecks and positive elements and will only improve following assignments. When appropriate ideas for a follow-up and key-persons will be identified. When a debriefing is organized by Agriterra NAJK will be invited at all times!
h. NAJK is project leader for the three year  program Support to Young Farmers of Benin in which a total of 75  young farmers will be assisted developing entrepreneurial and marketing skills. Several activities are included:
1. Dragons' Den, identification  of young farmers who can participate in the program. In the Den they present their individual  business plans to the Benin working group and Fupro .
2. Survey continuity of the program, organize and prepare activities and involve NAJK-members

The project aims at developing a method to protect natural forests in Madagaskar where deforestation and forest fragmentation are problems. Forest restoration and creation of buffer zones by planting trees which provide food and wood for local people are s
tarted in the pilot phase and continued in the project. Alternative methods of local agriculture are also introduced. In the project the purpose is to develop a forest monitoring system utilising remote sensing which results in interactive updating interne
t-based maps. Local capacity in monitoring is improved. In the future the results can be applied in REDD projects for instance.

Les stratégies de lutte contre linsécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle dans la zone dintervention identifiées par lanalyse contextuelle constituent les axes principaux autour desquelles sarticulent les actions des organisations partenaires et forment les résultats du cadre logique de lintervention. Les organisations partenaires contribuent ensemble à latteinte des résultats et des objectifs de lintervention AMSANA en exécutant des composantes ou sous-composantes de lintervention (Résultats et Sous-Résultats) en fonction de leurs expertises et expérience.

Lintervention AMSANA vise à latteinte des 5 résultats suivants : 
-	Résultat 1: La sécurisation de la disponibilité des produits vivriers et maraîchers et des revenus qui en découlent
-	Résultat 2: Les populations bénéficient de services économiques adaptés pour laugmentation et la diversification de leurs revenus
-	Résultat 3: Meilleures pratiques nutritionnelles et d'hygiène dans les communautés des villages ciblés
-	Résultat 4: Les stratégies et les interventions dappui relatives à la sécurité alimentaire et à la prévention de la malnutrition sont mieux prises en charge, priorisées et exécutées aux différents niveaux institutionnels du programme
-	Résultat 5: Des effets multidimensionnels sur les ménages ciblés, l'efficience du programme et lappropriation des bonnes pratiques à tous les niveaux dintervention sont renforcés

Des stratégies destinées à renforcer légalité hommes/femmes, à protéger et améliorer lenvironnement et à atténuer limpact négatif du changement climatique ont été développées et incorporées de façon transversale dans lensemble de lintervention.

LONG Croix-Rouge de Belgique prend en charge la quasi-totalité de la composante relative à la nutrition (Résultat 3, sous-résultats 3.1, 3.2 et 3.3) à lexception du sous-résultat 3.4 qui est exécuté par lONG Protos.

Why do agri-agencies do the work that they do? Because they think that that work (= strengthening producer organisations, farmers' unions, cooperative societies etc.) contributes to a fairer and more prosperous society. Without membership organisations that know how to promote the interests of their members, it is hard to see how fairness and democracy  can ever come into place. Alexis de Tocqueville is on our side: In order that men remain civilized or become so, the art of associating must be developed and perfected among them in the same ratio as equality of conditions increases. Besides, historically speaking, it is easy to argue that countries in Europe are, in general, pleasant to live in as a result of strong professional organisations,

This theory of change of the agri-agencies is not always accepted, sometimes even questioned. The goal of this project is to bring so much argumentation (see above) and empirical evidence together that it (the theory of change) becomes uncontested. Together with scientists, and under the coordination of Dutch research institutions and Agriterra, we wil do this in a book, to be published by October 2014: Family farms and producer organisations as generators of (rural) development.

1.	Goals

This project is to produce irrefutable evidence and publicity on the thesis of the agri-agencies that strong producer organisations have a positive influence on development, in at least three respects: economic growth, equality and democratization. The intuitive argument, the one from common sense, has never been phrased better than two centuries ago, by Alexis de Tocqueville: In order that men remain civilized or become so, the art of associating must be developed and perfected among them in the same ratio as equality of conditions increases. Historically speaking, it is easy to argue that countries in Europe are, in general, pleasant to live in as a result of strong professional organisations, preventing verticalism in decision-making and entrepreneurship. Bits and pieces of empirical evidence have also been coming forward. Its is now time to bring these intuitive and historical arguments together with real-life evidence.

2.	Proposed activities 

The task consisted and consists of the following activities:

	Dissemination of the call among relevant social scientists and practitioners, including the fellow agri-agencies (spring and summer 2013 
	Based on presentations and research activities that responded to the call, the symposium Producer organisations as generators of (rural) development was organized by CIDIN (Nijmegen), WUR (Wageningen) and Agriterra on October 10th, 2013 in Wageningen 
	Publication of a book on the topic at the occasion of the UN International Year of Family Farming (IYFF): Family farms, producer organisations and development. The book is to be edited by Roldan Muradian (CIDIN-Nijmegen), Jos Bijman (Wageningen UR) and Jur Schuurman (Agriterra). 
 
 The following time line applies for the book production: 
15 November 2013: Submission of abstracts (1 page) (see the Call, uploaded as a File under the Proposal tab)
1 December: Invitation to contribute full chapter 
Nov / Dec 2013: Editors put together synopsis of the book and negotiate with publishers 
15 January 2014: Submission of the draft contribution 
Jan + Feb 2014: Review by editors and outside reviewers 
28 February: Authors are notified about requested improvement 
30 April: Submission of final contribution 
October 2014: Book launch  

3.	Envisioned outputs and outcomes 

The main outcome is the book. It will seek to present the state of the art on socio-economic research on relationship between farmer organisations, producer organisations and other forms of economic collective action by family farmers worldwide and the impact on rural development and even development more generally. Since the World Bank published its 2008 World Development Report, producer organisations have been in the spotlight of academics and policy makers, due to renewed interest in agriculture as the main driver of rural development. Family farms are still the dominant organisational form in agricultural production, but major changes are taking place. Producer organisations have always been important for providing farmers with access to inputs and output markets. However, the increasing importance of vertical coordination in value chains and quality assurance schemes has changed the role of producer organisations and therefore their relationship with family farms. 
Producer organisations (POs) often have been associated with social capital. However, the academic debate on whether POs need to be based on existing social capital in order to function well, or whether they induce the formation of social capital, or both, is not settled. 

The book will target an audience of academics as well as practitioners interested in scientific research on the mentioned issues. It will consist of two types of contribution. About two thirds of the chapters will be academic contributions, such as literature reviews, empirical studies, conceptual papers. About one third of the book will consist of more practice-oriented chapters, such as case studies of intervention projects. It will be published by an international academic publishing house. 

Together with the experts on communication within AgriCord (and perhaps in the framework of task 15: external communication) a strategy will be devised to give due attention to the publication and its tenets, in order that the overall purpose is served: general acceptance and awareness of the thesis/axioma.  

4.	Involvement of other agri-agencies

	discussion and modification/approval of these draft TOR in Montpellier (11-12 November, 2013)
	presentation of potential contributions (abstracts) and recruitment of researchers in the respective home countries who are willing to present an abstract. UPA-DI (Canada) is actively searching for possible input. 

5.	Budget (December 2013  October 2014)

Taskmanager (Jur Schuurman): 10 days in 2013, 21 in 2014 = 31 days 
Associated task manager 1 (Kees Blokland): 5 and 10 days = 15 days 
Ass. task manager 2 (Martin Couture): 5 days 
Translations, original research, publisher's fee: 50.000

Total	EUR 95.368

6.	Proposed team leader 

Jur Schuurman, senior management advisor at Agriterra. Kees Blokland (Agriterra) and Martin Couture are involved.

7.	Justification 

With this task, AgriCord hopes to contribute to the general acceptance of the vision that development is a matter of people and their organisations. If they do not play a role in policy discussions and the realisation of concrete projects, development will never be sustainable, in the sense that there will be no ownership by the main stakeholders of development: the people who want to lift themselves out of poverty. If this vision is indeed accepted through (among others) corroboration by scientific research, the need for an elaborate impact assessment system on the work of agri-agencies will be less pressing. In other words, this project is an attempt to make the development effectiveness  of the agri-agencies' work uncontested. 

In the envisaged book, after setting forth a few more  theoretical and historical arguments, we will proceed to mention a few mechanisms that underpin this train of thought. Among them: 
	Organisations are a school for democracy instead of violence, since they make dialogue possible by their very nature 
	Organisations and associations enable joint conceptualization and policy formulation (which is always more effective than the sum of many individual formulations)
	They are a channel for uploading (from members to society as a whole) and downloading (the other way round) information, goods and services
	They enable specialisation and mobilisation of labour and capital
	They increase market power for individual farmers

Although smallholder farmers produce 90% of Ugandas total food output and 70% of these are women, many young women smallholder farmers in Northern Uganda (Lira, Apac, Alebtong, Dokolo and Oyam districts) do not generate sufficient income to sustain their livelihoods and provide nutritious food for themselves and their children. Gender inequality within household, community and society inhibits their access to agricultural inputs, good farming practices, market information, and affordable nutritious food. 
This project (1 April 2017  31 March 2020) combines a Women Empowerment in Agriculture approach with contract farming. The project targets the soy sector since its potential is grossly underexploited in Northern Uganda. The innovation of gender transformative contract farming lies in the incentives it creates for farmer groups to pursue gender equality within all their operations. This includes the application of bylaws on gender equality, as well as providing women with equal access to improved farming inputs, and capacity building on financial, entrepreneurial and marketing skills. 
At the end of the project, 2,500 smallholder farmers (80% young women) will be socially and economically empowered, and their livelihoods and food security will be improved beyond the project lifetime.

In order to do so, that research has to be effectively communicated and strategically positioned. IDRC endeavours to do this is by engaging potential research users in the research process, and training research partners in communication skills (writing, publishing, presentation, etc.). IDRC is supporting an evaluation of experiences of research uptake in order to understand to what extent, where and why some research becomes influential and other research does not. This project seeks to answer the following questions. What theories underpin the influence strategies used by IDRC? Where have those theories been tried and with what results? In what contexts do those theories seem to be effective or ineffective? Does IDRC use an appropriate range of strategies compared to other research funders? The first two questions will be addressed in Part I of the project.",4.0,,,2011-09-30,2013-09-30,International Development Research Centre,,Other Public Sector,15.0,Canada.

These districts and councils differ from the trained under HIP 2016 (Maganja da Costa, Namacurra, Mutarara and Caia). Local Disaster Risk Management Committees strategy would be based on offering tailor made improvements, supporting INGC to implement sustainability solutions, and providing training in first aid to key members of the LDRMC. 31 new communities along the basins will be included in data winners in HIP 2017 so communities targeted under HIP 2016 will not be included under HIP 2017. If due to the comprehensive approach of this new intervention some overlapping exists, the components of the actions implemented will be different (avoiding double funding).Intervention includes also activities at institutional level, reinforcing the District Comissions of the Red Cross in terms of means and training, as well as at the national level, in specific areas such as Cash Transfer.

UNFPA ska själva bidra med 4 miljoner SEK. Projektet har ett mål på medellång sikt att öka tillgången och användningen av service för sexuell- och reproduktiv hälsa samt familjeplanering bland unga människor mellan 10 och 19 år. Det långsiktiga målet är att bidra till en minskad andel tonårsgraviditeter i Liberia, vilket för närvarande ligger på en hög nivå . Det huvudsakliga utvecklingsproblemet som insatsen avser att bemöta är den nu begränsade möjligheten att nyttja sina rättigheter inom sexuell och reproduktiv hälsa, särskilt för unga flickor och pojkar.

Fase II :: El proyecto pretende potenciar la organización de mujeres en dos comunidades rurales de la comune de Djedougou en Malí. Al mismo tiempo fortalecer las capacidades productivas en torno a dos ejes estratégicos: Un primer eje a través de talleres de formación para mujeres sobre los aspectos fundamentales de la organización, legalización y gestión de asociaciones de mujeres, y Un segundo eje está vinculado con la producción de alimentos y la mejora de los cultivos a través de la rehabilitación de dos huertos comunitarios de mujeres pertenecientes a estas asociaciones con el objetivo de generar ingresos que mejoren la autonomía y la autoestima de las mujeres asociadas El proyecto se desarrollará en tres fases; una primera fase de socialización, organización y elaboración del POA, una segunda fase consistirá en las labores de construcción de pozos para riego, cerramiento de los jardins de femmes ? huertos comunitarios de mujeres, construcción de los centros de reunión y almacenaje y la puesta en marcha de la producción, y una tercera fase, paralela a la anterior será la realización de ciclos formativos, mediante metodología participativa, pero adaptada al nivel académico de las socias. Con esto se espera que las asociaciones de mujeres tengan capacidad para mejorar su organización, mejorar sus ingresos y favorecer el acceso a alimentos básicos para sus familias.

There are two components to the components to the project. The project follows a results-based financing mechanism and disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs) representing targets to trigger disbursement are specified for each year of implementation of the Government program of the same name. One DLI focus area pertains to the use of a specific geographic targeting formula to allocate fiscal resources to ensure pro-poor coverage. The DLI target for 2013, for this focus area, will need to be changed as the follow-on Safety Net Systems for the Poorest (SNSP) Project, which will commence implementation and support the same Government program during the same year, includes an updated geographic targeting formula based on new national poverty statistics. It was agreed during negotiations for the SNSP Project that the new DLI targets agreed for the Government program will apply to the EGPP Project, thereby necessitating an amendment to the EGPP project's financing agreement. This will constitute a level two restructuring. The changes will amend the DLI target for geographic targeting in 2013 to ensure that the provisions under the EGPP Financing Agreement, and the recently signed SNSP financing agreement, are aligned.

Forest resources are used unsustainably in and around Kiwengwa-Pongwe Forest Reserve because of poor farming techniques lack of available land and limited livelihood opportunities in the 12 villages surrounding it. For the same reasons the communities also
 suffer from food insecurity which threatens their right to adequate food. Project aims to tackle these development problems by enhancing sustainable forest management including both conservation and sound usage of forest resources and improving food secur
ity of these communities. To achieve its objectives the project supports agroforestry and other livelihoods such as sea shell and sea weed farming and livestock and beekeeping by providing training and initial material support to groups of community member
s hoping to develop their livelihoods. It also supports tree planting establishes tree nurseries in the area builds wood fuel saving stoves raises environmental awareness and provides capacity building to community based forestry actors.The development pol
icy objectives of gender equality and reduction of inequality are met by supporting livelihood groups of women and agricultural production in which women have an important role and by improving the availability of stable food crops crucial to the most vuln
erable members in the communities. Integrating trees into farming systems planting trees promoting improved stoves and livelihoods relying on forest well-being will conserve biodiversity and biomass in the area so as to combat climate change. While diversi
fying local people's livelihoods will help the communties to adapt to the effects of climate change.The direct beneficiaries of the project are the 26 supported groups engaging in their livelihood initiatives 200 households receiving wood fuel saving stove
s 11 Forest Conservation Committees (FCCs) and the local partner DFNR. In the end the project benefits the entire village communities of approximately 28 000 inhabitants by improving the access and availability of food in their villages. The project is mai
nly working with the existing structures of and between DFNR FCCs and the village communities but it also supports the activities of newly established umbrella organization of FCCs called Kiwengwa-Pongwe Community Forest Conservation Network (K-P CFCN). K-
P CFCN will receive capacity training during the project for it to fully function as a community based organization enhancing local level forest management in the future.

Compared to a slight improvement in 2015. According to the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Index for 2015, Zambia is ranked 116, out of 145 countries. This means that Zambia is rated among the worst 30 countries with the highest levels of gender inequality in the whole world. Zambia is also ranked third highest country with cases of child marriages in the SADC region, according to Girls Not Brides, with 42% of women aged 20-24 years married by the age of 18, many of whom live in rural areas among the poor and marginalized communities. Approximately 25.7% of adult women have reached a secondary or higher level of education compared to 44.2% of their male counterparts. Gender inequality is a key determinant of risky behaviour in sexual relationships. In addition, gender inequality contributes to hinder womens access to adequate information, education and services on health. This project will stimulate the debate among children and youths concerning gender relations in their own schools, communities and jointly reflect on possible measures to overcome the negative effects of gender inequality. Public events in the covered communities will address the issues of gender as well as of child and youth policies in the context of gender. This action will promote an open dialogue among children, youths and parents on these issues. As girls do not drop out from school due to early marriage, the number of girls attaining basic or higher education is expected to increase, which in turn contributes to more informed choices about teenage pregnancy. Parents are expected to assume more responsibility for the future of their girls and change socio-cultural patterns that expose them to risks of particularly dropping out of school, early or forced marriages. Project outcomes:
1. Increased girls and young peoples (aged 10 to 24 years) access to and retention in education reduces their vulnerability to contracting HIV.
2. Reduced adolescent girls and young womens (aged 10  24 years) vulnerability to unintended pregnancy and Sexual Gender Based Violence. 
3. Improved livelihood skills of out of school young people aged 19 to 24 years for an effective response to poverty and HIV.
4. Improved knowledge on gender equality among young people (15-24 years), for an effective response to gender inequality and HIV.
5.

Humanitära samarbetspartners förmåga att svara mot dessa behov bedöms i respektive kontext, varefter Sida föreslår lämplig fördelning av tillgängliga humanitära medel till respektive land och partner. I början på 2018 rapporterade FN att 135 miljoner människor i 26 länder är i behov av humanitär hjälp. Flertalet av dessa människor är drabbade av matosäkerhetskriser, såsom i Somalia, Jemen, Nigeria, Sydsudan och Sudan.

Det nu föreslagna stödet avser ny finansiering till FN:s världslivsmedelsprogram (WFP) för stöd till humanitära insatser under 2018 och uppgår till sammanlagt 146,5 MSEK. Insatserna är fördelade mellan främst livsmedelsdistribution och transport i sammanlagt 11 länder.

WFP, grundad 1961, är en av världens största humanitära organisationer med närvaro i 80 länder och 14,000 anställda. WFP:s primära mål är att, genom livsmedelsbistånd, rädda liv och säkra försörjningsförmåga i kris- och katastrofsituationer. WFP är en mycket relevant organisation för det humanitära arbetet, då de har hög kapacitet inom logistik och förmåga att snabbt etablera sig i fält, även i högriskområden. Utöver att rädda liv genom matdistribution, bidrar WFP:s insatser till att upprätthålla människors värdighet genom bl.a. utdelning av kontanter som ökar människors självförsörjning. WFP arbetar för minskad global hunger vilket i sin tur förbättrar människors möjlighet att tillvarata sina mänskliga rättigheter. Över 90% av hela WFP:s personalstyrka arbetar på plats i länderna.

På senare år har WFP:s kontantbaserade insatser ökat markant där målgrupperna mottar pengar (elektroniskt, kontant eller via checkar), i stället för fysisk distribution av livsmedel. Detta har medfört mer kostnadseffektiva och flexibla insatser, i de kriser där fungerande marknader finns att tillgå. Genom att tillämpa landprogram påvisar WFP en djup förståelse för kopplingen mellan humanitärt bistånd och utvecklingssamarbete. Landprogrammen består av strategiska mål och fokusområden som behandlar grundorsaker, resiliens och krisrespons.

Sida har ett omfattande humanitärt samarbete med WFP sedan många år tillbaka. Organisationen mottar årligen både riktat humanitärt landstöd från Sida, såväl som s.k. kärnstöd från UD.

MATSTÖD OCH STÄRKT MOTSTÅNDSKRAFT
Av 2018 års stöd från Sida, totalt 146,5 MSEK avses 93,5 MSEK att används för akuta matsäkerhetsinsatser i form av:
1) Distribution av livsmedel till utsatta familjer, exempelvis ris, majs, matolja och socker.
2) Kontantbaserat stöd (vouchers och elektroniska kort) för inköp av livsmedel på lokala marknader.
3) Behandlande och förebyggande nutritionsinsatser, exempelvis genom distribution av särskilt vitamin- och proteinberikad kost till undernärda barn.

Stödet till akuta matsäkerhetsinsatser föreslås till följande kriser: 
1) Demokratiska folkrepubliken Korea (Nordkorea) 11 MSEK
2) Etiopien 25 MSEK 
3) Demokratiska republiken Kongo (DRK) 22,5 MSEK
4) Somalia 25 MSEK
5) Sudan 10 MSEK

UNHAS OCH LOGISTIK
På grund av exempelvis långa avstånd, pågående stridigheter eller bristfälliga vägar är många människor utom räckhåll för insatser. Därför föreslås att resterande stöd på 49 MSEK att användas till finansiering av United Nations Humanitarian Air Services (UNHAS), för att förbättra tillträde till människor i behov av humanitär hjälp. UNHAS transporterar även hjälporganisationers personal och bidrar till ökad säkerhet under arbete i fält.

Transportstödet riktas till följande kontexter: 1) Centralafrikanska republiken (CAR) 8 MSEK, 2) Tchad 5 MSEK, 3) Demokratiska republiken Kongo (DRK) 10 MSEK, 4) Kamerun 3 MSEK, 5) Mali 4 MSEK, 6) Niger 5 MSEK, 7) Nigeria 9 MSEK och 8) Sudan 5 MSEK.

Utöver ovanstående föreslås även 4 MSEK fördelas till Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC) i Nigeria. En begränsad del av stödet kommer att användas för insatser",2,,,2015-01-01,2019-12-28,WFP/WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME,,,,Sweden,SE-0,Government,10,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency,SE-6,Government,10,World Food Programme,41140.0,Multilateral,40.0,TD,Chad,100.0,,,,72050,Relief co-ordination; protection and support services,100,,1,1.0,110.0,10.0,C01,5.0,USD,,1182067.312825,1165789.165789,0.0,0,0.0,0,0

Thousands of Burundian refugees are sent back to their homeland every year from the neighbouring countries. The project helps refugees in Nyanza Lac in Burundi to reintegrate in the country. They are offered help to build their own house and they are also 
given agricultural tools, seeds and mosquito nets. So far 270 households have benefitted from this help. A health station, which the returning refugees can benefit from, is getting equipped and renovated through the project. Sewing courses are arranged for
 young women who otherwise would have difficulties supporting themselves. When they finish the course they are given a sewing machine and can start earning money by sewing clothes. The project is supported in cooperation with Community of Pentecostal Churc

This exclusion results in their prevalent poverty, inaccessibility of proper education, their low rate of socio-political participation, particularly as a rightful citizen.

Following the situation, Bhinneka Tunggal Ika Alliance (ANBTI) initiates an empowerment project with Marapu communities using participatory action strategy, which works closely with the involved communities. This approach enables the indigenous people to identify the key issues that they face and struggle, and to formulate appropriate action plans and advocation that are suitable for their condition. Organizing the communities has been the key to conduct the participatory action. By organizing, we would like to form a new community working as facilitator to implement the actions within theother communities. Through organizing as well, we are also capable of pinpointing potentials that are held by the communities and how to develop those potentials according to their needs. The involvement of local capacities and potentials is really crucial to maintain the sustainability of the program.

Organizing the communities also means to build a platform for the people to do many activities together with their members. Thus, it is necessary for the communities to build a communal space for collective gathering, discussions, and capacity development. We would like to establish Community-Based Learning Center. This new learning space for community is intended to be the starting point for driving changes in the community. A strong foundation of livelihoods enables the societyto effectively and significantly participate in the state as its rightful members, including to self-advocate their rights and needs, particularly regarding the administration and civil rights. Through this platform, the communities will run the program that is planned and constructed rogether to advocate their rights.",2,2018-09-01,2019-08-31,2018-09-01,2019-08-31,Oxfam Novib,NL-KVK-27108436,International NGO,21,Ministry of Foreign Affairs NL ,XM-DAC-7,Government,10,Oxfam Novib,NL-KVK-27108436,International NGO,21,Aliansi Bhinneka Tunggal Ika ,507682,,90,ID,Indonesia,,,,,4;15150,;Democratic participation and civil society,100;100,;,99;1,,110.0,30.0,C01,5.0,EUR,,0.0,25000,0,25000,0.0,0,0.0

Ansökande organisation:
Diakonia är en biståndsorganisation med kristna värderingar, vars huvudmän är frikyrkorna Svenska Alliansmissionen och Equmeniakyrkan. Diakonia har haft ramavtal med Sida sedan tidigt 1990-tal. Statusen som ramorganisation förnyades i början av 2014, efter att en ramkriteriebedömning genomförts. Diakonia har fyra regionkontor och 24 landkontor i Afrika, Asien, Latinamerika och Mellanöstern. 

Ansökan:
Ansökan utgör en förlängning av pågående ramprogram 2012-2014. Ansökan är inte komplett i sig själv, utan presenterar endast förändringar i förhållande till pågående program. Uppgifter som saknades i ansökan har Sida begärt in i efterhand från Diakonia. Bl.a. gäller det ett uppdaterat resultatramverk, en kostnadseffektivitetsanalys, en motivering av höjningen av budgeten samt en uppdaterad insatslista. Budgeten är inte korrekt uppställd, då indelningen av budgeten i verksamhetskostnader hos Diakonia respektive hos lokala samarbetsparter inte följer Sidas riktlinjer.

Ansökan omfattar 20 landprogram i Afrika, Asien, Latinamerika och Mellanöstern samt två regionala program i Afrika. Verksamheten är inriktad på fem tematiska områden: mänskliga rättigheter, demokrati, jämställdhet, social och ekonomisk rättvisa samt fred och försoning. Diakonia arbetar genom lokala samarbetsorganisationer. Totalt 233 ingår i denna ansökan. Kapacitetsutveckling av dessa utgör en viktig del av insatsen.

Diakonias övergripande mål är att förändra de politiska, ekonomiska, sociala och kulturella strukturer som skapar fattigdom, förtryck och våld. Diakonia stöder en bred krets av civila samhällesorganisationer med utgångspunkt från sin förändringsteori som fokuserar på medvetenhet och kunskap om rättigheter, mobilisering samt kollektivt agerande och påverkansarbete.

Förväntade resultat:
Förväntade resultat specificeras per land/regionalt program. Det är stora skillnader mellan programmen i hur resultaten utformas. Sida bedömer att de förväntade resultaten i flera fall är på en väl övergripande nivå, men de indikatorer som anges konkretiserar dem och gör dem uppföljningsbara. Exempel på förväntade resultat, ett från varje region, inom några vanliga tematiska områden är:
""Kenya: Förbättrad tillgång till rättslig prövning för rättighetsbärarna.""
""Peru: Andinska lantbrukarorganistioner och urfolksorganisationer i Amazonas genomdriver sina kollektiva rättigheter för hållbart nyttjande av naturresurser och för att minska sårbarheten vad gälller klimatförändringar, på ett jämställt, rättighetsbaserat och interkulturellt sätt, genom att utveckla sin kapacitet för påverkansarbete och för att skapa och genomföra alternativa förslag.""
""Bangladesh: Jämställdhet har stärkts och fördomar relaterade till kön har minskat"".
""Libanon: Diakonias partners har stärkt sin organisationskapacitet och tematiska kunskap."" 

Tidigare resultatuppfyllelse:
Sidas bedömning, baserat på tidigare erfarenhet och ramkriteriebedömningen är att Diakonia har god förmåga att uppnå resultaten. Resultatrapporteringen pekar ofta på resultat i termer av att rättighetsbärare har blivit stärkta och kapacitet hos samarbetsorganisationer har ökat. Exempel på tidigare resultat inom ett par områden:
- Demokrati: I Burkina Faso har samarbetspartners arbetat med att demokratisera gruvindustrin bl.a. genom kompetensutveckling och informationskampanjer. Det finns nu ett starkt engagemang för att eliminera barnarbete i gruvorna.
- Jämställdhet: Kvinnoorganisationer i Bolivia, Peru och Colombia har utvecklat elva förslag på lagar och policys för att skydda kvinnors rättigheter. Förslagen berör områden som kvinnors rätt till land, trakasserier och politiskt våld mot kvinnor, trafficking och kvinnors deltagande vid fredsförhandlingar.
- Samarbetsorganisationers kapacitet: I Mali, DRC och Somalia har representanter för samarbetspa",4,,,2015-01-01,2016-10-28,DIAKONIA,,,,Sweden,SE-0,Government,10,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency,SE-6,Government,10,Donor country-based NGO,22000.0,National NGO,22.0,EG,Egypt,100.0,,,,15150,Democratic participation and civil society,100,,1,3.0,110.0,10.0,B01,5.0,USD,,341754.35682600003,341487.932471,0.0,0,0.0,0,0

Es befindet sich derzeit in der vierten Phase (BMZ-Nr. 2011 65 729). Die fünfte Phase wurde als Vorratsprüfung bereits geprüft. Die Unterzeichnung des Finanzierungsvertrags der Phase V ist für 2013 vorgesehen. Mit durchschnittlich fast 8 Geburten pro Frau, sowie einem hohen Vorkommen an schwangerschaftsbedingten Komplikationen ist Familienplanung ein zentrales Thema für die nigrische Gesundheitspolitik. Trotz einer stabilen HlV-Prävalenz von 0,7% ist das Risiko der Ausbreitung der Epidemie insbesondere in dicht besiedelten Gebieten und in den Grenzgebieten im Süden, sowie bei Menschen mit erhöhtem Infektionsrisiko (Prostituier-te, Fernfahrer) deutlich höher (ca. 36%). Das übergeordnete entwicklungspolitische Ziel der FZ-Maßnahme ist die Verbesserung der sexuellen und reproduktiven Gesundheit und Rech-te der nigrischen Bevölkerung durch die Verringerung von sexuell übertragbaren Infektionen, insbesondere HIV, die Vermeidung ungeplanter Schwangerschaften und die Vergrößerung der Geburtenabstände. Das Programm richtet sich mit der HIV-Komponente an Zielgruppen wie Fernfahrer und Prostituierte, aber auch an die allgemeine Bevölkerung im reproduktiven Alter. Die Social Marketing Agentur (SMA) ANIMAS-Sutura hat sich als dynamische und umsetzungsstarke Durchführungsstruktur etabliert und vermarktet mittlerweile neben Kondomen und der Pille auch Wasserreinigungstabletten. Im August 2012 begannen die Aktivitäten der Phase IV (5 Mio. EUR). Die vorratsgeprüfte Phase V sieht ebenfalls 5 Mio. EUR vor.

Uganda has signed International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 1987, but there are significant shortcomings in the Ugandan legislation, including the Constitution, with respect to ESC rights. ESC rights under valuation will inevitably 
lead to deficiencies in state funds resourcing and public awareness of their rights. ESC rights are unevenly realised across the country and in different population groups, particularly the most disadvantaged are suffering from the situation. The project a
ims to build the capacity of beneficiaries so that they are acting on behalf of ESC rights and call for their implementation. The project also aims at strengthening ESC rights-related legislation and improving the access to the ESC rights-related services.
 The project capacitates women's groups and local organizations to monitor the implementation and promote the realization of ESC Rights. Iser's Board members responsible for the ISER?s operations have a diverse educational background and experience, and th
us the organization has diversified expertise in the various economic, social and cultural rights. www.iser-uganda.org

During their strategic review meeting there was strong emphasis on scaling up prevention work especially amongst the key populations who according to National AIDS Council are the youth and the commercial sex workers. Zimbabwe has the fifth highest HIV prevalence in Sub Saharan Africa at 15%. 1.4 million People are living with HIV including 170000 children equating to 4% of the Global total 14.7% adult prevalence rate.According to statistics released 2010, 59% of PLWHIV are still not accessing treatment. At the Durban Conference held last year 2016, it was reinforced that if no scaling up is done; 10.9 million people will die by 2030. New infections are also a cause of concern, which puts so much pressure on the already constrained Health budget.. In the ZNASP 111, stakeholders identified gains made to date and that promotion of smart investment is focused for high interventions targeting children, adolescents, young people, and key populations  women in sex work, women and people living with disability.

Mashambanzou theory of change has  four pillars of :
1. Gender, Human Rights Environment and Legal Support.
2. Treatment and support of PLWHIV
3. Psychosocial Support 
4. Socioeconomic Support
all anchoring on ensuring that communities that Mashambanzou works in are healthy and resilient. This project will focus on working on interventions targeting children, adolescents, young people, and key populations  women in sex work, women and people living with disabilities in the affected communities Glen Norah, Hopley and Nyabira.
The focus of the interventions will also include internationally recommended approaches such as:
1. Comprehensive case management and referrals
2. Behaviour change programme that incorporate SRHR and Child Protection for the youth and adolescents
3.Engaging youth /children living with HIV for both treatment care and support as well as stigma reduction.
4.Promote economic empowerment and livelihoods for support group members.",3.0,,2020-03-30,2017-04-01,,,,,,Catholic Agency For Overseas Development (CAFOD),GB-CHC-285776,International NGO,21.0,,,,,Mashambanzou Care Trust,,National NGO,22.0,ZW,Zimbabwe,,,,,13040;14030;16064;16064;31130,STD control including HIV/AIDS;Basic drinking water supply and basic sanitation;Social mitigation of HIV/AIDS;Social mitigation of HIV/AIDS;Agricultural land resources,40;10;10;20;20,;;;;,1;1;1;1;1,,110.0,30.0,C01,5.0,GBP,,0,33497.1600,0,39832.0000,0.0,0,0.0

We Effect har inkommit med en ansökan om rambidrag för 2017 på sammanlagt SEK 188 033 400 för en ettårig förlängning av det program som genomförs under ramanslaget 2014-2016. Sida har därför beslutat att bereda insatsen som ett kompletterande insatsbeslut. Sida bedömer att ansökan är relevant under den nya strategin för stöd genom Svenska organisationer i det civila samhället (CSO-strategin) 2016-2022 och beslutar om ett bidrag om 180 000 000 SEK. Denna beredning har genomförts i samarbete mellan handläggare Eva-Lotta Gustafsson och USAID:s sekondering till Sida Joshua Haynes.

Ansökande organisation: 

We Effect är en ideell, partipolitiskt och religiöst obunden organisation vars syfte är att stärka medlemsbaserade och demokratiska organisationers förmåga att göra det möjligt för fattiga kvinnor och män att förbättra sina levnadsvillkor, försvara sina rättigheter och bidra till ett rättvist samhälle. We Effect bildades 1958 och har varit ramorganisation sedan 1978 under namnet Kooperation Utan Gränser. Organisationen är en demokratiskt strukturerad förening och bakom We Effect står ett sextiotal medlemsorganisationer från den svenska konsument- och producentkooperationen. We Effect är en väletablerad organisation i det svenska samhället, med ett öppet och demokratiskt arbetssätt - och med en stark internationell förankring.

We Effects vision är en hållbar och rättvis värld fri från fattigdom och organisationen arbetar inom landsbygdsutveckling och bostäder, inkluderat rätten till mark, jämställdhet och finansiella tjänster. Ansökan omfattar 17 program på regional eller landnivå och ett globalt program som totalt består av 160 projekt i 24 länder. 

Sida beslutade 2014 att förnya We Effects status som ramorganisation. 

Ansökan:

Ansökan bygger på We Effects prioriteringar och följer logiskt på tidigare verksamhet. We Effects ramansökan för 2017 är en fortsättning på det ramprogram som genomförs under pågående ramavtal 2014-2016.

Syftet med stödet är att stärka partnerorganisationen som sådan och att detta i sin tur ökar organisationens förmåga att å ena sidan påverka och kräva förändring på makronivå/strukturell nivå och, å andra sidan erbjuda medlemmarna efterfrågade tjänster. Enligt We Effects förändringsteori genomförs den huvudsakliga verksamheten av partnerorganisationerna. Inom programmen för landsbygdsutveckling stödjer We Effect bondeorganisationer i deras arbete med att öka sina medlemmars inkomster och tillgång till mat genom t.ex. jordbruksrådgivning, stärkt position på marknaden och hjälp med förhandlingar om priser. Organisationen förespråkar ett hållbart och klimatanpassat jordbruk och stödjer också lokala spar- och kreditföreningar som gör det möjligt för lantbrukare med små resurser att spara och låna pengar samt få tillgång till försäkringar. Inom bostadsprogrammen arbetar We Effect med lokala bostadskooperativ där medlemmarna tillsammans bygger sina bostäder. Kooperativen bedriver påverkansarbete för tillgång till bostadskrediter och säkrad rätt till mark att bygga på. Jämställdhet är ett prioriterat område för We Effects verksamhet. We Effect strävar efter att integrera jämställdhet i all verksamhet och organisationen stödjer partnerorganisationernas arbete med att stärka kvinnors rättigheter, bland annat genom kvinnligt ledarskap, en mer rättvis arbetsfördelning i jordbruket samt genom att försvara kvinnors rätt till mark. 

Målgruppen för We Effects utvecklingssamarbete är kvinnor och män som lever i fattigdom och som är medlemmar, eller potentiella medlemmar, i kooperativa organisationer, andra demokratiska föreningar eller informella grupper vilka arbetar för att uppnå gemensamma mål.

Förväntade resultat:

We Effects ansökan har resultatmatriser på land- och regional nivå, med indikatorer och utgångsvärden. På global nivå finns en resultatmatris men utan aggregerade utgångs- och målvärden. Ansökan har följande mål:

Beslutet tas i enlighet med Sidas insatshanteringsregel paragraf 3.11.3. Genom detta beslut ersätts den tidigare ÖK:n och dess fem tillägg i syfte att göra avtalstexten mer överskådlig.

Sida och MSB ingick i maj 2014 en ÖK om humanitära insatser genom MSB för perioden 2014-2017. Inom ramen för ÖK:n allokerades initialt 85,000,000 SEK för 2014, 20,000,000 för 2015, samt 10,000,000 för 2016. Efter begäran från MSB fattades den 21 juli 2014 beslut om att tillföra ytterligare 20,000,000 för utbetalning 2014 i syfte att möjliggöra för MSB att fortsatt kunna svara mot nya humanitära behov under året. Beslutet föranleddes av en osedvanligt hög takt på hemställningar om medelsanvändning, vilket i sin tur speglade det exceptionellt svåra humanitära året. I enlighet med ÖK:n inkom MSB i januari 2015 med sin årsplan för året där nya medel äskades, varefter Sida beslutade om ytterligare 50,000,000 för 2015 för en total initial allokering på 70,000,000. I samband med halvårsöversynen 2015 tillfördes MSB ytterligare 30,000,000. 

I tillägg till redan beslutade och överenskomna 10,000,000 för användning med start 2016, fattas härmed beslut om att tillföra ytterligare 60,000,000. Totalt blir därmed den initiala allokeringen för 2016 70,000,000 varav max 20,000,000 får planeras för bl.a. kapacitetsstärkande insatser inom huvudområde 2.

Totalt belopp på insatsen blir 275,000,000, medan totalt överenskommet belopp 2014-2017 blir 412,600,000. Detta pga. tre beslut under 2014 om medeltillförsel från andra anslagsposter, för ebola-relaterad verksamhet, samt internflyktingrespons i Irak. Dessa hanteras som separata insatser i Sidas insatshanteringssystem, men är kopplade till samma överenskommelse som detta och tidigare beslut enligt listan på första sidan.

I övrigt är insatsen i allt väsentligt endast marginellt förändrad. För justerade bedömningar och uppdateringar se bilagd beredning. 

MSB har ett behov av att Sidas medel i dess helhet betalas ut i början av året för att undvika att stå utan medel att hemställa om vid hastigt uppkomna kriser. Sida delar bedömningen att det föreligger ett behov att snabbt kunna använda mekanismen för finansiering av insatser. Med hänsyn till detta bedöms det motiverat att, med avsteg från Sidas normala rutiner om utbetalning vid ett flertal tillfällen per år, besluta om utbetalning på årsbasis.",2,,,2014-05-01,2019-09-28,MSB/MYNDIGHETEN FÖR SAMHÄLLSSK,,,,Sweden,SE-0,Government,10,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency,SE-6,Government,10,Donor Government,11000.0,Government,10.0,,,,289.0,"South of Sahara, regional",100.0,72010,Material relief assistance and services,100,,1,1.0,110.0,10.0,C01,5.0,USD,,361521.304975,289838.13475100003,0.0,0,0.0,0,0

I september 2018 godkände Världsbankens styrelse en ny fyraårig strategi för Somalia 2019-2022 (s.k. Country Partnership Framework, CPF). Detta är Världsbankens första strategi för Somalia på 30 år och signalerar ett förnyat förtroende hos Världsbanken avseende Somalias åtagande för landets utveckling. Världsbankens CPF finansieras för närvarande av 10 givare genom stöd till den specifika fonden (Multi-Partner Fond) för implementering. Sverige är fjärde största bidragsgivare. MPF-modaliteten innebär en givargemensam finansieringsmekanism, vilket även är den finansieringsform som föredras i konflikt och postkonflikt kontexter. MPF är en av tre finansieringsmekanismer som inrättats i Somalia som en del av landets utveckling- och återuppbyggnadsarkitektur. MPF administreras av Världsbanken i nära samarbete med Somalias federala regering och givarna. MPF anses ligga väl i linje med regeringens prioriteringar och artikulerar väl den nationella utvecklingsplanen (2017-2019) genom att återspegla planens samtliga åtta pelare. Sida bedömer att MPF har en hög grad av nationellt ägandeskap och är väl anpassad till övriga principer om utvecklingseffektivitet. Som förvaltare av fonden är Världsbanken övergripande ansvarig, vilket innebär att tillgängliga medel liksom vidareförmedling av MPF-medel sker i enlighet med insatsavtal. 

MPF har ett specifikt fokus på stöd till statens kärnfunktioner, socioekonomisk återhämtning och hållbar utveckling jämfört med FN:s Somaliafond som är mer omfattande. Den fond som implementeras av Afrikanska Utvecklingsbanken (AfDB) fokuserar på rehabilitering och utveckling av infrastruktur. Sida har allokerat stöd till FN-fonden sedan 2015 (beslut nr 2015002435 och 2018001376). AfDB-fonden började 2017 men Sida ger inte stöd till denna. 

Det övergripande målet med CPF 2019-2022 är att lägga grunden för långsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande ekonomisk tillväxt. Fokus är på prioriteringar och utvecklingsutmaningar som upprätthåller landets nuvarande s.k. ""dual development trap"", vilken består av en låg grad av tillit som förstärks av utbredd sårbarhet till följd av återkommande chocker. Världsbankens strategi har två fokusområden (1) förstärkt kapacitet hos landets institutioner att leverera samhällstjänster och (2) förstärkta ekonomiska möjlighet och motståndskraft. Det första fokusområdet kommer att innebära fortsatt stöd till pågående satsningar inklusive nytt fokus på finanspolitiskt utrymme och förbättrad tillgång till samt kvalitet på viktiga samhällstjänster. De enskilda programmen kommer specifikt att inriktas på reformering av statens offentliga finanser, inhemsk skattemobilisering och resursfördelning, tillgång till grundläggande sociala tjänster och resiliens. Det andra fokusområdet syftar till att stärka landets ekonomiska motståndskraft som grund för långsiktig fattigdomsminskning och inkluderande tillväxt genom att förbättra förutsättningarna för företagande och ökade möjligheter för marknadstillträde, ökad tillgång till kapital för finansiell inkludering, ökad grad av digitalisering, samt förbättrad tillgång till vatten och förnybar energi. Världsbankens nya strategi avser perioden 2019-2022. Sidas förslag till ny finansiering uppgår till stöd under 2019-2020 med sammanlagt 200 miljoner kronor samt stöd till nuvarande MPF-program på 75 miljoner kronor för 2018. Beroende på om och när Världsbanken lyckas säkra ytterligare IDA-finansiering (International Development Association) samt om Världsbanken justerar nuvarande planer för resultat inom hälsoområdet i linje med Sidas rekommendationer, kommer Sida att överväga ytterligare medel till MPF under 2021-2022.

För att reglera Sidas insats till Världsbankens Multi-Partner Fund (MPF) för Somalia 20182021, använder Sida och Världsbanken den avtalsmall som överenskommits i december 2016 av rådgivande g",2,,,2018-11-01,2022-06-28,IBRD/INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RE,,,,Sweden,SE-0,Government,10,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency,SE-6,Government,10,International Bank for Reconstruction and Development,44001.0,Multilateral,40.0,SO,Somalia,100.0,,,,15116,,100,,1,1.0,110.0,10.0,B03,5.0,USD,,1582205.652213,431510.632421,0.0,0,0.0,0,0

The Project will provide technical support to the Ministry of Education for the reform of the pre-service teacher education system. Expected outcomes include: improved enabling environment for teacher policy and teacher education reform; new competency-based teacher education curriculum and policies in line with international standards, human rights, gender equality, and teacher rights; the supply of high quality, specialized, primary and middle school teachers that meet the demands of diverse learners in Myanmar; and improved human resource and financial management systems that support the implementation of an updated competency-based degree. STEM is contributing to both the upstream and downstream work of improving pre-service teacher education in Myanmar. The upstream work is focused on advocacy and capacity building for developing the necessary policy and curriculum frameworks for the system. The downstream work has a strong focus on capacity development of teacher educators and department personnel to: develop and deliver new courses, improve pedagogy, strengthen college management and ICT systems, and to create a knowledge platform and networks among the colleges.

Most notably, mobiles reach more than 70% of the population. Nevertheless, access to online government services is quite uneven.

This project will support LIRNEasia, a Sri-Lanka based information and communication technology policy and regulation think tank, in improving government service delivery to the poor through online and mobile applications. It will first assess the factors inhibiting wider participation in government services offered through mobile applications, such as public utility management, pension and welfare payments, and agricultural information. Second, LIRNEasia will analyze digital data such as ATM use, Internet traffic, and location information from mobile phones to inform delivery of government services. This data could answer questions such as: What are the optimal locations for delivering government services? How integrated are the different parts of cities? How far do those who work in cities commute? 

A third component of the project will provide timely assistance to increasingly open Burma as it develops communications policies aimed at reducing its exclusion from the information society. Finally, the proponents will research how best to ensure the quality of mobile and household broadband access to the Internet as more people in Asia connect online.",4.0,,,2012-09-24,2015-03-24,LirneAsia,,Regional NGO,23.0,Great Britain.

TP1 complements the other thematic programmes on Education and on Growth and Employment, by enhancing the Afghan states capacities for accountability, transparency, inclusion and non-discrimination. TP1 builds on Denmarks experience of governance in Afghanistan, streamlined and focused on key areas such as anti-corruption that have the highest probability of impact in the current context.

For TP1, there are three central trends of interest. First, improved systems and procedures within the GIRoA are increasingly targeting corrupt practices and misuse of funds. Afghanistan has recently undergone a PFM and Accountability Assessment in accordance with the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) approach.  Overall, the assessment is positive. To a large extent, Afghan and international participants in the ARTF Public Financial Management Reform Programme II (PFMR II) can take credit for the improvements. Nevertheless, Afghanistan remains one of the most corrupt countries in the world, ranking 166th out of 168 countries appearing in front of Somalia and North Korea in Transparency Internationals 2015 Corruption Perception Index.  This highlights the continued need to focus on combating misuse of funds and corrupt practices.  Pressure on PFM systems is expected to increase as more donor funding goes on-budget. There is thus a continued need to focus on financial management, as well as improving performance through public sector reform.

Second, sub-national governance remains a challenge in Afghanistan, but with pockets of positive developments. There is a need to enhance the degree of service delivery at local level, in particular in rural areas where access to services is limited. Improved sub-national governance will enhance the legitimacy of the GIRoA.

Privately-owned boreholes can be an important supply of water but their regulation is not enforced. Recent research has found the quality of water at boreholes in three of Nairobis slums to be dangerously poor, containing high levels of harmful bacteria and e-coli. Also that good hygiene practice is uncommon. As a result, local people suffer, and can even die from, diseases such as typhoid fever, diarrhoea and cholera. This project aims to promote safe drinking water and encourage a more sustainable approach to water provision and hygiene. Rather than building new boreholes, the project will make existing boreholes more efficient, cost-effective and safer. Training will be provided so that facilities can be maintained. There will also be hygiene promotion in schools and the community. As a result, people in the slums will be able to source clean water more cheaply and there will be a reduction in water-related diseases contributing to better health and school attendance.

According to the Politique Nationale Genre du Mali, Mali has ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and its Optional Protocol and is a signatory to the Beijing Platform for Action, the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights at is Protocol on Women#s Rights.Mali also has obligations under the African Union Gender Policy which requires parity among women and men in systems of governance. The United Nations Security Council#s series of resolutions on women, peace and security require all member states to ensurethe protection and participation of women in all security, justice, and conflict / post-conflict processes.
Women#s participation in political processes and decision-making is weak in Mali.  In spite of a high women#s voter turnout during the presidential elections, there was only one female candidate running in the elections. And political parties have been resistant to putting forward female candidates for the legislative elections.  There are only 4 (out of 34) female Ministers with women similarlylacking in other senior government positions. Lessons from other countries demonstrate that supporting increased women#s political participation requires an enabling environment for women, including access to justice, strong rule of law and a culture of zerotolerance for sexual and gender-based violence againstwomen.  It also requires the support of men, especially male cultural, religious, and political leaders. This project seeks to increase marginalized citizens, particularly women#s political participation by increasing theirs roles in local and national governanceand improving their access to justice.",3,2014-08-01,2015-03-31,2014-08-01,2015-03-31,Oxfam Novib,NL-KVK-27108436,International NGO,21,Oxfam Novib,NL-KVK-27108436,International NGO,21,,,,,Femmes Droit et Développement en Afrique WILDAF/MALI,506031,,24,ML,Mali,,,,,4;5;15150,;;Democratic participation and civil society,70;30;100,;;,99;99;1,,110.0,30.0,C01,5.0,EUR,,0.0,92601,0,92601,0.0,0,0.0

There will be a detailed review towards the end of the pilot phase so that lessons learned can be employed to perform adjustments to the design of the
expansion phase. The Programme was initially designed with three components, however, a fourth component (Infrastructure) was introduced at a later stage to ensure that the Programme fully realize its goal.

Indien står för 20 procent av den globala mödradödligheten och 26% av befolkning lever under fattigdomsgränsen, och fortsätter att ha en av de högsta mödradödlighetstalen i världen. Således framsteg i Indien (trots långsam hittills) är en förutsättning för att kunna uppnå millenniemål 5 till 2015. Syftet med dessa statliga program är att minska mödradödligheten genom att främja institutionella förlossningar, och genom att minska hinder för att kvinnor ska ha tillgång till mödrahälsovård. Dessa program verkar i tre stora indiska provinser. Vart och ett av dessa program fungerar med hjälp av olika innovativa ?demand side? finansieringsmekanismer, som särskilt syftar till att förbättra tillgången för utsatta grupper. Denna ansökan föreslår utvärderingar och jämförelser av dessa tre program: (I) Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) i Madhya Pradesh i centrala Indien: en villkorlig kontant överföring till fattiga mödrar vid förlossning på ett statligt sjukhus. (Ii) Chiranjeevi Yojana (CY) i Gujarat i västra Indien: ett fast belopp till privata sjukhus, mot utgifter för varje 100 förlossningar som genomförs på fattiga mödrar. (Iii) Thayi Bhagya Program (TBP) i Karnataka i södra Indien: en villkorlig kontant överföring till fattiga mödrar vid förlossning på privata sjukhus. Alla betalningar görs av staten. Även om båda programmen är baserade på liknande begrepp, det vill säga ekonomiska incitament för tillhandahållande och utnyttjande av mödrahälsovård, och deltagande av den privata sektorn finns det stora skillnader i de socioekonomiska sammanhangen där varje program verkar. Detta inkluderar finansieringsmekanismer, modeller av leverantörsbetalningar och incitament, mängden av ekonomiskt bistånd, nivåer av den privata sektorns deltagande, vilka alla kommer att ha betydelse för önskade resultat av mödrahälsovård. Inga utvärderingar av liknande stora ?demand side? finansieringsprogram för mödrahälsovård har tidigare genomförts. Fältet är relativt nytt, och senare vetenskaplig litteratur har rekommenderat robusta utvärderingar för att fylla kunskapsluckan när det gäller inverkan av liknande insatser. Detta förslag behandlar denna kunskapslucka.",2,2012-01-01,2014-12-31,2012-01-01,,,,,,Sweden,SE-0,Government,10,The Swedish Research Council,SE-29,Government,10,Karolinska Institutet,51000.0,"Academic, Training and Research",80.0,,,,998.0,"Developing countries, unspecified",100.0,12182,Medical research,100,,1,1.0,110.0,10.0,D02,,USD,,265922.084829,179585.44844100002,0.0,0,0.0,0,0

Its important knitwear sector is however lagging behind, due to its concentration on traditional winter garments produced from relatively heavy, plain yarns available in Bolivia.

The idea behind the project is to boost the competitiveness of local knitwear companies and associated hand knitters, through the utilisation of so-called fancy yarns. Fancy yarns are made with distinctive colour changes, special texture, irregular profile and/or a blend of various fibres that make them stand out against traditional plain yarns. Still using mostly Alpaca and Llama fibre as a basis, fancy yarns allow the production of much lighter and diverse knitwear, also for summer collections and according to the latest trends in fashion.

The applicant, Pitata S.A.C. from Arequipa, is active in the procurement of Alpaca fibre and in the commercialisation of yarns and tops for the textile industry in Peru and abroad. Local partner, Altifibers S.A. from El Alto, is a producer of fibre tops and yarns of Llama, Alpaca and sheep. Third partner, AslanTrends USA Corp from Washington, USA, is a producer of a wide variety of top quality yarn products from natural fibres, sourced from South America. The three partners will set up a joint venture to produce fancy yarns in Bolivia.

The factory will be set up on the premises of the local partner in El Alto, and will create direct employment for 35 persons at the plant, as well contract another 40 independent makers of ""hanks"", a very labour intensive activity. The staff will be extensively trained to acquire the know-how and skills required to produce high quality fancy yarns, which will be sold to the local industry as well as on the international market. A state-of-the-art air control system and waste water treatment plant, along with OHSAS 18001 certification, will ensure that the environment is protected and working conditions are healthy and safe.

The proposed production of fancy yarns will generate considerable additional demand for Llama and Alpaca fibre, benefiting a large number of rural producers. The project will include a pilot to certify the natural fibre supply chain according to the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), which will bring additional income to farmers through the organic premium.",2.0,2012-07-01,2018-12-31,2012-07-01,,Netherlands Enterprise Agency,NL-KVK-27378529,Government,10.0,Netherlands Enterprise Agency,NL-KVK-27378529,Government,10.0,,,,,"Pitata SAC, Peru",,Private Sector,70.0,BO,"Bolivia, Plurinational State Of",100,,,,32163,"Textiles, leather and substitutes",100,,1,,110.0,,,5.0,EUR,EUR,750000.00,675000.00,0,750000.00,0.0,0,0

Föreslås oöronmärkt bidrag till ICC TFV med 30 miljoner SEK över tre år för verksamhet enligt ansökan, daterad 2016-06-02.

Den Internationella Brottsmålsdomstolen, ICC, instiftades som del av Romstadgan, 2002. Parallellt etablerades också en specifik fond för offer för brott under ICC:s jurisdiktion - ICC Trust Fund for Victims.
Syftet med fonden är att kombinera straffande och reparativ rättvisa. Fondens två mandat tillåter den att både använda medel som tillkommer fonden via skadestånd och via frivilliga bidrag för att på så sätt kunna ersätta både specifika offer som identifierats i särskilda rättsprocesser samt offer som inte inkluderats i ett specifikt åtal men som ändå erkänns som brottsoffer. Detta tudelade mandat benämns i ICC TFV:s vokabulär ""reparations"" (av domstolen utdömt skadestånd) respektive ""assistance"" (bredare stöd till offer för brott föremål för ICC:s utredning). 

Genomförandet av verksamheten sker i samarbete med lokala och internationella partners på grundval av ICC:s Financial Rules and Regulations och Regulations of the Trust Fund for Victims, Resolution ICC-ASP/4/Res.3, 2005. Sverige har deltagit i beslut om ICC:s interna regelverk i egenskap av signatärstat. 

ICC TFV har för närvarande pågående projekt inom sitt bredare stödmandat i norra Uganda och DRC, och planerar att expandera till Elfenbenskusten, Kenya, Centralafrikanska republiken och Mali. När det gäller fondens formella gottgörelsemandat, pågår just nu förhandlingar om hur detta ska utformas i relation till det första fallet där ICC avkunnat domslut som innehåller brottsofferersättning (reparations) - Thomas Lubanga, fälld för rekrytering och användning av barnsoldater i Ituri, DRK. 

Sverige är signatärstat och del av ICC:s statspartsförsamling. Svenskt generellt finansiellt stöd till ICC utgår via UD. 

Sverige har stött fonden sedan 2006, inledningsvis med ett stöd från UD. Sida slöt första gången avtal med ICC om stöd till TFV 2011 för stöd motsvarande 10 000 000 kronor över två år. Följande avtalsperiod omfattade 36 000 000 kronor över tre år, 2013-2015. Sidas erfarenheter av TFV är positiva och samarbetet har fungerat väl. Stödet motiveras av att fonden, som instiftades som en integrerad del av Romstadgan, bidrar till att rikta fokus mot upprättelse för offer för folkmord, krigsbrott och brott mot mänskligheten som komplement till ICC:s verksamhet som rättslig instans. 

Sidas bedömning är att fonden behöver ytterligare medel för att genomföra sitt uppdrag. 5 miljoner Euro är avsatta för projekt i DRK och Uganda. Drygt en miljon Euro är avsatta för förstudier, kapacitetutveckling för partners, uppföljningssystem mm. Därutöver finns ett utrymme motsvarande 600 000 Euro för stödprogram i nya länder, förutom DRK och Uganda, vilket inte är tillräckligt för att utvidga stödverksamehten till fler länder. TFV har fonderat 5 miljoner Euro för att genomföra formellt utdömd skadestånd/brottsofferersättning, varav 1 miljon Euro är avsatt för gottgörelse till offer i Lubanga-fallet. Detta ger ICC TFV beredskap för arbeta med de ytterligare domslut som avkunnats och som kan komma att avkunnas inom flera pågående mål. 

Ett nytt system och ramverk för planering, uppföljning och resultatrapportering är utarbetat, och ska tas i bruk under kommande period.

At the same time, interactive web-based services and applications, including wikis and social networking sites are experiencing explosive growth worldwide. These Web 2.0 technologies, as they are collectively known, have already had a significant impact on people's social lives and political action, as well as industries like advertising and the media. However, the role that these technologies could play in linking research and policy is largely unexplored territory.

This project will therefore examine how and under what circumstances Web 2.0 technologies could be used to link research, advocacy and policy in Latin America. The project will have two components. The first will focus on how Web 2.0 tools can be used to promote research, policy and advocacy linkages in national information society agendas. The second will take the form of a competitive research fund linked with the Regional Fund for Digital Innovation in the Americas (FRIDA). The competition is designed to gather information about and to evaluate innovative experiences in using Web 2.0 tools and behaviour to link research and policy. The awards will be presented at the Inter-Ministerial Conference on the Information Society to be held in Lima, Peru, November 2010.

Das Vorhaben ist zusammen mit den TZ-Maßnahmen in das deutsche Programm zur Unterstützung der Dezentralisierung und Guten Regierungsführung im Schwerpunkt eingebettet. Die umzusetzenden Projekte entstammen den unter Einbeziehung der Bevölkerung und ihrer gewählten Vertreter (auf Dorf, Zelle, Sektor und Distrikt-Ebene) erstellten Distriktentwicklungsplänen der Gemeinden und bedienen die Bedürfnisse der lokalen Bevölkerung landesweit in allen 30 Distrikten. Bei ihrer Auswahl liegt die Priorität vor allem auf jenen Projekten, die die Entwicklung des ländlichen Raums und der lokalen Wirtschaft fördern und zur Armutsbekämpfung beitragen können. LODA ist für die Umsetzung der Mittel mehrerer Geber sowie der ruandischen Regierung zuständig. Mit dem FZ-Beitrag werden neben den direkten Investitionen für lokale Infrastrukturprojekte auch Consultingleistungen zur Stärkung der institutionellen Kapazitäten von LODA finanziert. Die entwickelten Handbücher und Systeme, zum Beispiel für Instandhaltung der Infrastruktur und für Monitoring kommen über LODA auch den Distrikten zugute. Ziel des Vorhabens ist die Verbesserung der Versorgung der Bevölkerung in den Distrikten Ruandas mit relevanter und bedarfsgerechter Infrastruktur. Zielgruppe ist die Gesamtbevölkerung Ruandas in den 30 Distrikten (ca. 11,7 Mio. Menschen).

Projektet uppstod ur ett behov som EAC-regionen har att finna lösningar på de utmaningar som klimatförändringar ställer regionen inför, t.ex. en livsmedelsförsörjning som påverkats av återkommande torka. Dessutom har EAC-regionen begränsad kapacitet att delta i multilaterala handelsförhandlingar och begränsad förmåga att i dessa engagera regionens gräsrötter, och därmed begränsad kunskap om fattigas intressen och behov. I slutet av det första projektet genomfördes en konsultation med projektets intressenter och då framkom att det fanns en stor efterfrågan på ett fortsättningsprojekt, och då med fokus på jordbruksförädling. Den externa utvärderingen som genomfördes 2014 rekommenderade att projektet förlängs med en ytterligare projektperiod för att fånga upp och förstärka de positiva resultat som uppnåtts under den första projektperioden.
Syftet med PACT EAC2 är att fortsätta att bygga upp kapaciteten hos EAC regionen för att bättre förstå och använda kopplingar mellan klimatförändringar, handel och livsmedelsförsörjning i relation till jordbruksförädling, samt förbättra kapaciteten hos EAC-länderna i WTO och UNFCCC-förhandlingar. Det övergripande målet är att främja klimatvänlig och handelsdriven jordbruksförädling i EAC regionen för att minska fattigdom och förbättra livsmedelsförsörjningen genom holistiska nationella, regionala och multilaterala strategier och i avtal på handels-, klimat- och jordbruksområdet. Projektet syftar också till att öka EAC:s förmåga att påverka multilaterala handels- och klimatförhandlingar samt att förbättra kopplingen mellan politiska beslutsfattare och gräsrötter i EAC-regionen.",2,,,2018-05-01,2018-12-28,NIRAS SWEDEN AB,,,,Sweden,SE-0,Government,10,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency,SE-6,Government,10,Private sector in provider country,61000.0,Foundation,60.0,,,,289.0,"South of Sahara, regional",100.0,33130,Regional trade agreements (RTAs),100,,1,1.0,110.0,10.0,C01,5.0,USD,,60986.836048000005,60393.192488,0.0,0,0.0,0,0

Insatsen har genomförts i en första program-fas av Svenska kyrkan i samarbete med omkring 110 lokala civila samhällsorganisationer (CSO), trosbaserade organisationer och lokala kyrkor i flertalet länder i Afrika, Asien, Latinamerika och Mellanöstern under 2014-2016 med stöd från Sida/CIVSAM som uppgått till 291 000 000 SEK, i syfte att stärka civilsamhällets kapacitet och bidra till följande program-mål:

-	Människors rätt till sexuell och reproduktiv hälsa och rättigheter har stärkts.
-	Människor som lever i utsatthet har rätt till grundläggande trygghet och har stärkt social och ekonomisk egenmakt.
-	Människor har fått ökad trygghet, möjlighet och egenmakt att hantera konflikter och delta i freds- och försoningsprocesser.
-	Kvinnor och män har förbättrade förutsättningar och möjligheter till jämställt deltagande, röst och ledarskap i kyrka och samhälle.
-	Människors rätt till kroppslig och sexuell integritet i kyrka och samhälle har stärkts. 

Svenska kyrkan har föreslagit en förlängning av insatsen, på basis av dess existerande resultatramverk, med en budget på 119 419 916 SEK för år 2017 vilket motsvarar en ökning om 23% jämfört med föregående år. Utifrån en samlad bedömning och med hänsyn till tillgängliga anslagsmedel föreslås i Sidas beredning att ansökan för 2017 finansieras med 105 000 000 SEK. Ny total budget för insatsen 2014-2017 blir därmed 396 000 000 SEK.

För år 2017 har Svenska kyrkan budgeterat för utbetalningar till lokala samarbetsparter till en summa på 108 523 921 SEK, varav 94 904 250 SEK ingår i ansökan för 2017 och resterande del är utbetalningar av Sida-medel som redan är avtalade inom Svenska kyrkans EU-projekt. Denna totala andel som vidareförmedlas uppgår till 70% av totala budgeten för ram-insatsen och den redan avtalade EU-insatsen, beräknat på andelen utbetalningar som går direkt till lokala parter som Svenska kyrkan har avtal med. Att Svenska kyrkan räknar in Sida-stödet till egeninsatsen till sitt EU-projekt i andelen som vidareförmedlas påverkar inte bedömningen av ansökan för 2017. För tydlighetens skull kommer dock Sida be Svenska kyrkan att redovisa Sida-stödet till EU-insatsen separat i nästa ansökan. Av de medel som vidareförmedlas 2017 kommer 46 MSEK fördelas till parter i Afrika (Etiopien, Liberia, Sydafrika, Sydsudan, Uganda och Zimbabwe), 11,5 MSEK till Asien (Indien och Burma/Myanmar), 23 MSEK till Latinamerika (Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras och Haiti), och 14,4 MSEK till Mellanöstern (Egypten och Israel/Palestina). Inga utbetalningar kommer att ske till internationella avtalsparter eller svenska CSO. 

De lokala samarbetsparterna uppgår till omkring 110 CSO och/eller CSO-nätverk. Storleken på bidragen varierar mellan 80 000 SEK till omkring 5 MSEK. Svenska kyrkan räknar Lutherska världsförbundets (LVF) lokala/nationellt registrerade landkontor bland sina lokala CSO-partners. Svenska kyrkans samarbete med de lokala LVF-programmen utgör en stor andel av det totala stöd som förmedlas  närmare 22 %. I förlängningsansökan 2017 motsvarar det totalt 24,5 MSEK. Av dessa går 282 000 SEK till ett globalt program som administreras av kontoret i Genève  alla övriga medel går direkt till LVF:s landprogram och det arbete dessa kontor bedriver självständigt i samverkan med lokala CSO. Med egna medel stödjer Svenska kyrkan utöver detta den koordinerande funktionen i Geneve med 4,9 MSEK 2017, vilket kommer det lokala arbetet till godo bland annat gällande kvalitetssäkring och utvärdering. Medan den koordinerande funktionen via LVF i Genève bidrar med kvalitetssäkring av LVF-projekten, genomför Svenska kyrkans personal kvalitetssäkringen av övriga projekt inom programmet.

Verksamhetskostnaderna hos Svenska kyrkan, vilket inkluderar kostnader som relaterar till handläggning av Sida-finansierade program och projekt, inklusive lön, fältbesök etc, kommer att uppgå till 16 679 000 SEK år 2017.

The rationale for the six target countries is predominantly based on high prevalence of child marriages. Mali too has one of the highest child marriage prevalence rates in the world, on average, one out of two girls will be married by age 18. In 2010, 55 percent of the women 20-24 years of age were married/in union before age 18.
Child marriage is a violation of childrights. It denies the child, the basic right to good health, nutrition, education, and freedom from violence, abuse and exploitation. Child marriage also denies the child the right to be precisely that: a child, as it removes her/him from the care and protection of her/his family (and in most cases from school too) and throws her/him prematurely into the world of adults, with a number of burdens and responsibilities that the child is not prepared for. Although child marriage has a negative impact on boys and girls alike, the consequences are much more severe for girls and young women who often lack the status and power within their marriages and theirhouseholds. Save the Children and Oxfam Novib propose an integrated strategy that builds on current programming and complements that of others, whilst strengthening the work of Government and community based agencies and fills the gaps in the target locations in the six countries. The overall programme proposal focuses on the six strategies as formulated by UNFPA and the Dutch MOFA in its Child Marriage Fund, whereby priority, type and number of strategies differ per proposed target areas as follows:
1. Empower girls andenhance their position through developing their knowledge and skillsregarding SRHR and rights (in Afghanistan, Niger, Mali, India, Bangladesh, )
2. Increasing access to formal education for girls (in Afghanistan, Niger)
3. Work with local communities to addressharmful traditional/social norms and practices (in Afghanistan, Niger, Mali, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh)
4. Improve the economic situation of vulnerable girls and their families(in Afghanistan, Bangladesh)
5. Development and support for implementation of childmarriage legislation and policy (in India, Bangladesh)
6. Improve access to SRH services for married and unmarried girls.

At this time, most families producing milk in the zone do no transformation or value added after milking and many deliver their milk directly to intermediaries who pay below the market price. This project is aligned with Component 1 producing more and better and particularly with Component 3 marketing more and better of the SumajMikhuna/Andean Eco Food regional program.
The goal is to contribute to local socio economic development by building the inclusive dairy value chain, to increase farming families income by 25%. This will involve improving pastures and dairy cows; a gathering center will be implemented as well as two transformation centers, and an existing one will be upgraded; marketing circuits will be increased; technical skills and training will be improved and local employment will be generated. The project will address three key aspects:
1) Improving marketing by matching the supply generated with the demand from Ecuadorian dairy industries (Nestlé, Alpina, Reyleche, Indulac, Tony). At the same time, the project matches small-farmer products with short, diversified, local marketing circuits, such as agroecological farmers shops, fairs and markets. They will also match with urban sectors directly, through consensus-based supply / demand, to deliver baskets of small farmers products to families, schools, etc.
2) Developing associative gathering and transformation of surplus milk from participating families and rural organizations, complementing with improvement in the quality and volume of milk produced.
3) Strengthening organizations structure, administration and management of the microenterprises generated.",3,,,2014-01-08,2016-06-30,,,,,,,,,,,,,Heifer International,US-EIN-35-1019477,International NGO,21.0,EC,Ecuador,100,,,,1,,100,,99,,,,,,,,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0

We Effect har inkommit med en ansökan om rambidrag för 2017 på sammanlagt SEK 188 033 400 för en ettårig förlängning av det program som genomförs under ramanslaget 2014-2016. Sida har därför beslutat att bereda insatsen som ett kompletterande insatsbeslut. Sida bedömer att ansökan är relevant under den nya strategin för stöd genom Svenska organisationer i det civila samhället (CSO-strategin) 2016-2022 och beslutar om ett bidrag om 180 000 000 SEK. Denna beredning har genomförts i samarbete mellan handläggare Eva-Lotta Gustafsson och USAID:s sekondering till Sida Joshua Haynes.

Ansökande organisation: 

We Effect är en ideell, partipolitiskt och religiöst obunden organisation vars syfte är att stärka medlemsbaserade och demokratiska organisationers förmåga att göra det möjligt för fattiga kvinnor och män att förbättra sina levnadsvillkor, försvara sina rättigheter och bidra till ett rättvist samhälle. We Effect bildades 1958 och har varit ramorganisation sedan 1978 under namnet Kooperation Utan Gränser. Organisationen är en demokratiskt strukturerad förening och bakom We Effect står ett sextiotal medlemsorganisationer från den svenska konsument- och producentkooperationen. We Effect är en väletablerad organisation i det svenska samhället, med ett öppet och demokratiskt arbetssätt - och med en stark internationell förankring.

We Effects vision är en hållbar och rättvis värld fri från fattigdom och organisationen arbetar inom landsbygdsutveckling och bostäder, inkluderat rätten till mark, jämställdhet och finansiella tjänster. Ansökan omfattar 17 program på regional eller landnivå och ett globalt program som totalt består av 160 projekt i 24 länder. 

Sida beslutade 2014 att förnya We Effects status som ramorganisation. 

Ansökan:

Ansökan bygger på We Effects prioriteringar och följer logiskt på tidigare verksamhet. We Effects ramansökan för 2017 är en fortsättning på det ramprogram som genomförs under pågående ramavtal 2014-2016.

Syftet med stödet är att stärka partnerorganisationen som sådan och att detta i sin tur ökar organisationens förmåga att å ena sidan påverka och kräva förändring på makronivå/strukturell nivå och, å andra sidan erbjuda medlemmarna efterfrågade tjänster. Enligt We Effects förändringsteori genomförs den huvudsakliga verksamheten av partnerorganisationerna. Inom programmen för landsbygdsutveckling stödjer We Effect bondeorganisationer i deras arbete med att öka sina medlemmars inkomster och tillgång till mat genom t.ex. jordbruksrådgivning, stärkt position på marknaden och hjälp med förhandlingar om priser. Organisationen förespråkar ett hållbart och klimatanpassat jordbruk och stödjer också lokala spar- och kreditföreningar som gör det möjligt för lantbrukare med små resurser att spara och låna pengar samt få tillgång till försäkringar. Inom bostadsprogrammen arbetar We Effect med lokala bostadskooperativ där medlemmarna tillsammans bygger sina bostäder. Kooperativen bedriver påverkansarbete för tillgång till bostadskrediter och säkrad rätt till mark att bygga på. Jämställdhet är ett prioriterat område för We Effects verksamhet. We Effect strävar efter att integrera jämställdhet i all verksamhet och organisationen stödjer partnerorganisationernas arbete med att stärka kvinnors rättigheter, bland annat genom kvinnligt ledarskap, en mer rättvis arbetsfördelning i jordbruket samt genom att försvara kvinnors rätt till mark. 

Målgruppen för We Effects utvecklingssamarbete är kvinnor och män som lever i fattigdom och som är medlemmar, eller potentiella medlemmar, i kooperativa organisationer, andra demokratiska föreningar eller informella grupper vilka arbetar för att uppnå gemensamma mål.

Förväntade resultat:

We Effects ansökan har resultatmatriser på land- och regional nivå, med indikatorer och utgångsvärden. På global nivå finns en resultatmatris men utan aggregerade utgångs- och målvärden. Ansökan har följande mål:

Beslutet gäller för ett fjärde och sista tilläggsår av ett ursprungligen 3-årigt avtal. 

Sida förmedlar stöd till UNICEF baserat på FN appeller samt UNICEFs Humanitarian Action for Children' (HAC). Bidraget kommer att allokeras till UNICEFs humanitära program öronmärkt för aktiviteter på landnivå. Sida finansierar de humanitära appellerna per land enligt behoven som finns enligt UNICEFs handlingsplan (HAC) för varje kris. Inom det humanitära systemet är UNICEF en viktig aktör och genom detta stöd kommer organisationen att kunna fortsätta att ge livräddande stöd till de mest utsatta grupper som barn och kvinnor i humanitära krissituationer. 

Sidas stöd till UNICEF kommer att bidra med humanitär finansiering för att bistå utsatta grupper i humanitära kriser för att stödja samordnad och effektiv respons i de utvalda länderna. UNICEF ansvarar för att leda och samordna de globala klustren för nutrition, utbildning, vatten och sanitet samt har ansvar för barnskydd och könsbaserad våld. Stödet kommer att omfatta såväl nya akuta humanitära situationer som ännu inte har inträffat, som pågående eller eskalerande kriser.

UNICEF har framfört att tidig utbetalning av årliga bidrag för humanitära insatser är en förutsättning för att organisationen ska kunna ingå förpliktelser i sin tur i form av anställning av personal och kunna påbörja den upphandling av de varor och tjänster som behövs för programmen.Mot denna bakgrund gör Sida bedömningen att samtliga medel för projektet ska utbetalas omgående för att möjliggöra planering och uppstart av projektet till 1 januari 2017. Ett avsteg från Sidas vanliga rutiner om uppdelade betalningar bedöms motiverat.

UNICEF har en väl utvecklad logistik i form av att bygga upp lager i regionala depåer och en roll i det humanitära systemet att även förse andra implementerande partners med varor. Humanitära kriser är till sin karaktär snabbt skiftande både geografiskt och i intensitet, varvid UNICEF måste vara förberedda att kunna flytta såväl personal som förnödenheter. 

Sida Humanitära Enheten har för närvarandet ett 3-årigt avtal med UNICEF. Avsikten med detta beslut är att förlänga nuvarande avtal med ett år som täcker perioden 2017 vilket kommer att vara det sista året under detta avtal. För år 2018 planeras ett nytt 4-årigt avtal med UNICEF i syfte att komma i fas med organisationens planerade strategiska plan för 2018-2021. 

Stödet till UNICEF för 2017 innefattar två kategorier:

A) Landspecifikt stöd:
Den förslagna landfördelningen för 2017 (identifierade under allokeringsprocessen) omfattar totalt SEK 123 000 000 med stöd till UNICEFs humanitära arbete inom sektorerna hälsa, nutrition, utbildning, barnskyddsfrågor, könsbaserat våld och vatten och sanitet: 

Icke-öronmärkt stöd föreslås till UNICEFs humanitära program enligt följande:
1. Syrien krisen SEK 30 000 000 
2. Somalia SEK 9 000 000 
3. Demokratiska Folk Republiken Korea SEK 5 000 000 
4. Jemen SEK 17 000 000 
5. Nigeria SEK 25 000 000 
6. Libyen SEK 5 000 000 
7. Irak SEK 14 000 000 

Öronmärkt stöd föreslås till UNICEFs humanitära program enligt följande:
1. Etiopien SEK 15 000 000 (Hälsa, Nutrition, Vatten och sanitet)
2. Centralafrikanska republiken (CAR) SEK 3 000 000 (Rapid Response Mechanism/RRM)

B) Snabb responsmekanism i form av oallokerade medel: 
Genom detta avtalstillägg föreslås även ett stöd om SEK 59 000 000 för 2017 som UNICEF kan rekvirera och använda efter godkännande från Sida, för nya eller förvärrade humanitära kriser. UNICEF har föreslagit att dessa medel ska delvis (SEK 54 000 000) användas enligt följande: 

1. Myanmarkrisen i Bangladesh SEK 5 000 000, 
2. Somalia SEK 30 000 000, (öronmärkt för Hälsa, Nutrition, Vatten och sanitet)
3. Sudan SEK 9 000 000 samt

Med innovationer menas nya affärsmodeller, policies, teknologier, beteenden eller sätt att leverera produkter eller tjänster som gynnar människor som lever i fattigdom i utvecklingsländer. GIF vill bidra till storskaliga lösningar som ger miljontals människor möjligheten att öka sin livskvalité. 

För att åstadkomma detta har GIF ett flexibelt angreppssätt som skiljer sig från många andra fonder. GIF är öppen för alla typer av innovatörer (civilsamhällesaktörer, privata sektorn, myndigheter, akademin etc) inom alla sektorer. Finansieringen anpassas efter innovatörernas respektive behov och sträcker sig från ett par hundratusen till drygt hundra miljoner kronor i formen av gåvor, lån och/eller investeringar (equity). GIF har inga fönster eller ansökningsperioder utan är ständigt öppen för ansökningar. Syftet med detta flexibla upplägg är att säkerställa att inga innovationer faller mellan stolarna på grund av tematiskt eller geografiskt fokus, men också att öka konkurrensen för att få fram de bästa idéerna. 

GIF har en rigorös ansökningsprocess som beståd av flera olika steg, där innovationerna granskas inom fyra områden: Innovation and Impact, Potential to Scale, Measuring Success and Sharing Lessons Learned samt Team. Utöver detta görs ""due dilligence"" med fokus på t.ex. miljöfrågor, organisations- och finansiell kapacitet samt intern styrning och kontroll. En ansökan till GIF består av en kortfattad beskrivning av innovationen (t.ex. i text, video eller annat format), vilken granskas enligt ovan kriterier. De mest givande innovationerna ombeds skicka in en full ansökan. Därefter görs två av varandra oberoende granskningar av externa aktörer med relevant geografisk och tematisk expertis, som väljer ut ett fåtal innovationer för en slutgiltig diskussion med GIF angående finansiering. GIF räknar med att mindre än 5% av inkomna ansökningar lever upp till de hårda krav som krävs för finansiering. 

GIF accepterar tre olika sorters ansökningar beroende på ambitionsnivå och kapacitet hos innovatören - pilot, test and transition och scaling up. Tanken är att skräddarsy finansiering och eventuellt tekniskt stöd baserad på innovationens mognad. Vid varje stadie höjs ambitionsnivån och kraven på ansökan - en innovation kan gå genom alla steg men måste söka ny finansiering för varje steg i konkurrens med övriga sökanden. En central del i GIF är evidens och mätbara resultat. Tanken är att GIF ska möjlggöra för innovatörer att bevisa att deras innovation löser utvecklingsproblem på ett mer effektivt sätt än andra tillgängliga alternativ, och därmed få tillgång till ytterligare finansiering. 

GIF är ett icke vinstdrivande företag registrerat i Storbritannien. Företaget styrs av en VD som är ansvarig inför en styrelse, bestående av representanter från givare (Sida deltar som observatör) samt oberoende ledamöter, där de oberoende ledamöterna ska vara i majoritet. Styrelsen är i sin tur ansvarig gentemot GIF:s medlemmar, vilket i praktiken är samma sak som GIF:s givare eftersom alla som finansierar GIF har rätt att bli medlem. Det är viktigt att notera att medlemskap inte i någon mån innebär ägande - dvs Sida är inte en ägare av GIF och Sida bedömer därför att stödet inte strider mot Kapitalförsörjningslagen. 

GIF är ett givarinitierat program som är designat av främst USAID, DFID och Omidyar Network. Framförallt DIFD och USAID har varit mycket aktiva i designfasen, bl.a. genom att sekondera personal för att jobba med GIF under programmets uppbyggnadsfas. För att GIF ska fungera effektivt krävs att organisationen har stor flexibilitet och frihet att agera med liten hänsyn till strategiska prioriteringar och önskningar hos enskilda givare. Tanken är att givarna ska ha en begränsad roll i styrningen av GIF:s operativa arbete - istället ska den oberoend",2,,,2014-12-01,2019-12-28,GLOBAL INNOVATION FUND,,,,Sweden,SE-0,Government,10,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency,SE-6,Government,10,Donor country-based NGO,22000.0,National NGO,22.0,,,,998.0,"Developing countries, unspecified",100.0,32130,Small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) development,100,,1,1.0,110.0,10.0,B04,5.0,USD,,12778.611933,10399.440048,0.0,0,0.0,0,0

With U.S. support, the Government of Peru has adopted a successful counter-narcotics strategy focused on eradication, interdiction, and alternative development. Cacao is the most widely used crop substitute for coca in Peru. Under the first phase of the Peru Cacao Alliance, over 28,000 hectares of cacao were planted by more than 17,000 farmers. This activity, the second phase of the PCA (2016-2021), is implemented through a public-private partnership that includes 16 private enterprises, including cacao buyers, agricultural technology providers, lenders, and environmental investors. Together, these partners help improve farmer productivity and organization, and connect them to buyers in the growing global chocolate market, so they can earn a stable licit income and leave coca and poverty behind. FY 2018 funding will be used to scale up this public-private alliance's interventions to help at least 20,000 farmers improve cacao yields and quality. By the end of the five-year activity, USAID expects to leverage $50 million in private investment with a $25 million USAID investment, raise incomes for 20,000 households by an average of 30 percent, and increase cacao yields by 50 percent in areas formerly dominated by the production of coca used for cocaine. The alliance also helps formalize local businesses, boost trade, and support U.S. jobs. By increasing the supply of high quality cacao to U.S. markets, it feeds a flourishing confectionery industry that employs 70,000 U.S. workers along with a growing number of entrepreneurs and small businesses. The activity advances Embassy Lima's ICS Mission Objective 2.2 (to reduce the influence of transnational criminal organizations by sustaining coca reduction through alternative development) as well as NSS pillar II. The implementer was selected through a competitive process.",2,2016-09-01,2021-08-31,2016-09-01,,U.S. Agency for International Development,US-GOV-1,Government,10,U.S. Agency for International Development,US-GOV-1,Government,10,U.S. Agency for International Development,US-GOV-1,Government,10,Futures Group Global,,Private Sector,70.0,PE,Peru,100.0,,,,,,,,,1.0,110.0,10.0,C01,5.0,USD,,15671775.1,11907040.57,0,0,0.0,0,0

The following are key to their success: point-of-care training provided onsite in a clinical setting; case-based content; intermittent training sessions facilitated by peer trainers over time; and sustained educational support thereafter. This project will adapt the approach used in South Africa for Malawi, a more fragile health system where the challenge of integrating HIV services within primary care services is even greater. Working closely with the Ministry of Health and using a train-the-trainer model, researchers will test the approach, Simplified Tools and Training - Practical Approach to Lung Health, Malawi (STAT-PALM), in 31 rural health centres in Zomba district using a cluster-randomized trial. The training will focus on mid-level healthcare workers, that is, nurses, medical assistants and clinical officers. Outcomes measured will include staff retention and satisfaction, and patient outcomes with respect to HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria and other conditions seen in primary care.

Project contributes to the holistic development of girls and boys under 8 years in safe and stimulating environments and strengthens the capacities of parents in supporting the development of their children. Foundations for a balanced growth and developmen
t of a child are laid in the early years of life, even pre-natal. Early childhood care and development (ECCD) and its importance for a child?s later development are not well known in Bolivia. The project supports the development of holistic, cross-sectoral
 ECCD services in 14 municipalities across Bolivia together with health-, education- and child protection authorities. Capacity-building is offered to parents on good parenting practices from a holistic perspective with a special focus on involvement of fa
thers in the care and development of their children. Educators and teachers are supported in providing quality, gender equal and stimulating care and education. In addition, work on advocacy is carried out in order to influence legislation and budgets rela
ted to ECCD. Target group of the project is 15000 children and 9000 parents as well as a number of different authorities. The project is implemented in co-operation with the participating municipalities.

Die Nutznießer der Solarfinanzierungen werden Kleinst-, kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KKMU) sein, die bisher kaum an der Entwicklung des indischen Solarmarktes partizipiert haben. Unsere bisherigen Projekterfahrungen sowie die Gespräche mit Banken und Solarprojektentwicklern zeigen, dass insbesondere im Bereich der Solar-Finanzierungen für KKMU ein Engpass besteht. Die im Rahmen des Vorhabens unmittelbar unterstützten Gesellschaften (Finanzinstitute und Projektentwickler) sollen daher eine Vorreiter- und Demonstrationsfunktion für die Entwicklung dieses Marktes wahrnehmen.

The job creation elements of the Compact would focus on Ethiopias ambitious industrialisation plans. This would support improvements in the investment climate, investment promotion, and improving environmental and social standards in the manufacturing sector. This would create over 100,000 jobs, mainly for young women, in global value chains such as garments and textiles.

The programme will reach out to women fishers, entrepreneurs, craft producers and fish traders in three wards, increasing their access to and capacity for sustainable fish farming (tilapia breams), kapenta fishing and exploitation of forest products such as baobab, jatropha, moringa and establishing ecotourism facilities. Moreover, the programme will support women's ability to develop better producer-market linkages and increase their knowledge of economic policies, resulting in higher incomes for rural women.

Oxfam is a leading organization in emergency WaSH and Food Security in Mozambique since 1987.  Over the past five years Oxfam has implemented WaSH responses to benefit flood-affected populations in Sofala and Zambezia, cholera-affected populations in Sofala and Niassa, WaSH activities for east African refugees in Cabo Delgado and Nampula, and EFSL response for populations affected by three consecutive years of drought in Gaza.  In Mozambique Oxfam uses a single programmatic approach, linking activities in sustainable livelihoods, humanitarian assistance, good governance and gender for amore effective impact on beneficiaries.  In 2013, in coordination with COSACA members, Oxfam with its local partners implemented an emergency intervention to benefit more than 32,000 people in nine of the most flood-affected communities in Gaza and 8,000 people in Zambezia province through seeds and tools fairs, food security (EFSL) and access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene promotion (WASH).  The total funding mobilized was $2 million from theOxfam co-federation network and two bilateral donors.

Currently Oxfam is supporting 16,092 drought-affected households or 80,460individuals with FSL and WASH interventions and the food voucher system in Inhambane (Panda, Funhalouro, Mabote and Govuro districts), Sofala (Chemba District) and Maputo provinces (Matutuine, Moamba, Magude and Namaacha districts), together with its local partners. Oxfam proposes to cover the food insecure population in some IPC3/IPC4 districts. Those districts have been identified based on most recent figures and coordination with other agencies. The enrolment of additional districts will be considered if further funding becomes available in the coming months, which Oxfam continues to beactively seeking.",2,2017-04-03,2017-11-30,2017-04-03,2017-11-30,Oxfam Novib,NL-KVK-27108436,International NGO,21,French Government ,0020000244,Government,10,Oxfam Novib,NL-KVK-27108436,International NGO,21,Oxfam Novib,NL-KVK-27108436,International NGO,21,MZ,Mozambique,,,,,3;72010,;Material relief assistance and services,100;100,;,99;1,,110.0,30.0,C01,5.0,EUR,,0.0,108643,0,108643,0.0,0,0.0

Internationella, oberoende valmissioner genom EU eller OSSE som verkar i ett land under en valprocess gång ger ökad transparens och synliggör brister i det demokratiska systemet. Genom att rapportera och följa upp efter ett val finns möjlighet att påverka nationella valmyndigheter och på så sätt uppnå en stärkt demokrati. Sedan 1989 har svenska valobservatörer deltagit i internationella valobservationsmissioner. Observatörerna rekryteras och utbildas av Sida på uppdrag av regeringen och ställs till EUs eller OSSEs förfogande.

Sida och Folke Bernadotte Academy (FBA) kommer under första kvartalet 2015 att ingå en tjänsteköpsöverenskommelse som innebär att FBA kommer att sköta viss hantering av valresursbasen, t ex utbildning (bl a förberedelse inför missioner och säkerhet), kommunikation och administration.

Insatsregelns förenklade hantering är bättre lämpad för beredning av valobservation med hänsyn till nedanstående synnerliga skäl:
1. Regeringsbeslut fattas för varje enskild valobservation i början av varje år.
2. Valobservatörer är arvodesanställda av Sida under uppdraget och Sida betalar arvode och utlandstillägg samt ersätter kostnader för resor och uppehälle mot reseräkning. Sida står också för kostnader för förberedelseutbildning. Risken för korruption eller att bidraget används felaktigt bedöms därför vara mycket liten. Endast en smärre administrativ avgift, oftast ej överstigande 10 tkr, rekvireras av OSSE efter varje valobservation.",4,,,2015-02-01,2016-06-28,NOT APPLICABLE,,,,Sweden,SE-0,Government,10,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency,SE-6,Government,10,European Union Institution (EU),42000.0,Multilateral,40.0,,,,998.0,"Developing countries, unspecified",100.0,15151,,100,,1,1.0,110.0,10.0,D02,5.0,USD,,21066.162077,21066.21309,0.0,0,0.0,0,0

After foreign fishing companies operating on the coast of Senegal have caused the local fishing business to disappear unemployment in Mlomp village is even higher than the average 48 % in Senegal. The nurishment has become less and is missing on protein. T
he planned ostrich farm will produce a remarkable change on this situation. The project will create employment in farming in processing meat and eggs in sales and logistics and processing skins into products. This is expected to bring work opportunities fo
r women and young unemployed in particular. Strong handicraft tradition prevails in the village. The main problem in the village is that practically no employment is available specially for young people. The ostrich farm would create jobs for approx. 10 pe
ople for growing fodder and animal care and a larger number of jobs in handicrafts. The Mlomp village lives in a large extent in barter economy growing rice and vegetables, the people have very little money. After the investment and revenues arriving from 
outside Mlomp many people would earn directly or indirectly some money either from working at the farm or from selling handicrafts or from selling vegetables for those who are employed. Even a small income may have the impact that people feel empowered to 
stay in the village instead of moving to the cities where no employment or food is easily available. The farm workers would have regular income and the candicraft producers income from sales. The major part of the revenue would flow for the Association to 
be used for mutual benefit like eg. the sick fund.

These communities depend directly on the natural resources of the coastline, which were devastated by the 2004 tsunami and are damaged further by commercial scale fishing, mining and over-exploitation of mangrove forests. This project will support 700 Muslim and Moken families in six communities in Phuket Province.  140 are original families and 560 are POG families. Project participants will undergo Values-Based Holistic Community Development (VBHCD) training and establish at least 28 self-help groups (SHGs).  Of all SHGs, 20 percent will be women-only. Heifer will provide 1,710 geese, 3,400 fingerling and 12,323.35 in funds for livelihood and income generating activities to eight original groups (4 SHGs will receive animals and 4 SHGs will receive funds). Also, animal feed fund worth 4132.18 will be made available to animal-raising SHGs.  Project participants will be trained on VBHCD, Cornerstones, Participatory Self Review and Planning (PSRP), group saving management, improved animal management, natural resource management, livelihood skills and co-learning. The original families will pass on all livestock, funds and knowledge. Moreover, this project hopes to empower SHGs to take the lead in participatory natural resource management, as well as establishing a network of government agencies and non-governmental organizations on sustainable community development and natural resource management.",3,,,2009-07-01,2014-06-30,,,,,Private donations,,,,,,,,Andaman Resource Restoration (ARR),,National NGO,22.0,TH,Thailand,100,,,,1,,100,,99,,,,,,,,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0

Den omfattar 21 landprogram i Afrika, Asien, Latinamerika och Mellanöstern samt sex regionala program och ett globalt program för innovation inom området social och ekonomisk rättvisa. Diakonia arbetar genom lokala civilsamhällesorganisationer för det övergripande målet att förändra politiska, ekonomiska, sociala och kulturella strukturer som skapar fattigdom, förtryck och våld. Totalt 216 samarbetsparter ingår i ansökan. Verksamheten är inriktad på följande sex områden: mänskliga rättigheter (MR), demokrati, jämställdhet, social och ekonomisk rättvisa, konflikt och rättvisa, samt kapacitetsutveckling av samarbetsparter. Det som är nytt jämfört med tidigare är framför allt satsningen på fler regionala program inom olika områden samt det globala innovationsprogrammet.

Förväntade resultat:
Generella förväntade resultat formuleras för de sex områdena. Dessa är kopplade till förväntade resultat för varje program (dvs. per land/regionalt/globalt program), som i många fall består av ett urval resultat som är identiskt formulerade med de generella. Resultaten på programnivå konkretiseras genom indikatorer.

Exempel på förväntade resultat, ett från varje region, inom några vanliga tematiska områden är:
""Mali: Kvinnors politiska deltagande har stärkts på lokala och nationella nivåer"" (demokrati)
""Bolivia: Genderbaserat våld har minskat"" (jämställdhet)
""Bangladesh: Förutsättningarna för anständigt arbete och rättvis inkomst har förbättrats"" (social och ekonomisk rättvisa)
""Libanon: Kapaciteten hos Diakonias samarbetsparter att integrera miljö och konfliktkänslighet i sitt arbete (där relevant) har förbättrats."" (kapacitetsutveckling)

Tidigare resultat:
Resultatrapporteringen pekar ofta på resultat i termer av att rättighetsbärare har blivit stärkta och kapacitet hos samarbetsorganisationer har ökat. Exempel på tidigare resultat inom ett par områden:

MR: I Thailand har fem samarbetsorganisationer bistått tiotusentals statslösa personer i att uppnå juridisk status. Det innebär bl.a. att de fått rätt att arbeta och studera, samt tillgång till rättighetsbaserade tjänster.

Demokrati: I Mali har samarbetsorganisationer utbildats i medborgerlig budgetuppföljning och analys av offentlig politik. Det har lett till ökad budget för hälsa och utbildning i flera kommuner. I en provins publicerade alla kommuner sin ekonomiska redovisning 2014, till skillnad från 2012 då ingen kommun gjorde det.

Konflikt och rättvisa: Sju samarbetsorganisationer i Colombia, Honduras och Peru har ökat sin kunskap om det juridiska ramverket och har vidtagit legala åtgärder, som i några fall resulterat i att samhällen återvunnit mark från utvinningsföretag.

Grund för Sidas bedömning:
Samråd har inhämtats från ansvarig jurist vid Sidas avdelning för juridik och upphandling. Verksamhetscontrollern vid Sidas enhet för det civila samhället (CIVSAM) har konsulterats bl.a. för budgetfrågor. Synpunkter har också begärts in från de svenska utlandsmyndigheter (UM) samt andra enheter på Sida som hanterar bilaterala avtal med Diakonia. Därutöver har granskningar gjorts av integreringen av tvärfrågor i Diakonias verksamhet genom Sidas ramavtal för jämställdhet, helpdesk för miljö och klimat, respektive mänsklig säkerhet. 

Sidas bedömning av Diakonias ansökan baseras huvudsakligen på följande dokument:
- Slutrapport från ramkriteriebedömningen av Diakonia 2013 (Doxnr. 027413/13)
- Diakonias slutrapportering till CIVSAM för rambidraget 2012-2014 (Doxnr. 016518/15, 035857/15)
- Underlag från 12 UM samt två enheter vid Sida (för Doxnr. se avsnitt 7a i berednings-PM).
- Dokument relaterade till revisionsprocessen av Diakonia för 2012 och 2013 (Doxnr. 016523/13, 019056/14, 019049/14, 034408/14)

Objectif Spécifique 1: Accompagner les groupes PIEPP et les GVF dans le renforcement des capacités et le développement des activités économiques.
Objectif Spécifique 2: Consolider les liens entre les acteurs des 9 Pôles dEntreprises Agricoles où les organisations de producteurs de la FEPA.B sont les portes dentrées.
Objectif Spécifique 3: Renforcer les capacités organisationnelles et de gestion de 07 UPPA de la FEPA.B disposant de plans dactions pilotes.

Cela devra aboutir aux résultats suivants: 
Résultat 1 : la situation économique des groupes locaux PIEPP et GVF de microcrédit a évolué.  
Résultat 2 : Les liens entre les acteurs des 9 PEA où les OP de la FEPA.B constituent les portes dentrées sont consolidés ; 
Résultat 3 : Linnovation au  niveau organisationnel et managérial des unions sest accrue
Résultat 4 : Le suivi des activités réalisées par la coordination les unions et les groupes locaux est effectif
Résultat 5 : Les  organes de la  FEPA.B et la coordination technique fonctionnent de façon efficiente

Ainsi les activités suivantes sont prévues: 
	Formation en planification participative et suivi des activités
Les 07 unions à plans pilotes ciblées seront accompagnées dans la planification et le suivi annuel de leurs activités. Des sessions de planification permettront aux unions disposant de plans provinciaux (07) de lactualiser (pour prendre en compte le niveau local avec les groupes PIEPP, les GVF et les PEA au niveau de chaque province), de le mettre en uvre et de le suivre. Ces 7 unions seront accompagnées dans lexécution dau moins 60% de leurs activités planifiées.
 
	Poursuite de la structuration des OP à la base
Les orientations de la Stratégie de Développement Rural (SDR) à lhorizon 2015, retiennent lapproche filière comme démarche pour accroître, diversifier et intensifier les productions agro-sylvo-pastorales en liaison avec les besoins du marché. En effet, la démarche filière vise la conquête des marchés à travers lamélioration des circuits dapprovisionnement identifiés. 

	Formation à lauto-évaluation des activités
Lauto-évaluation des activités est un exercice qui permet de se retourner pour voir le chemin parcouru et corriger les erreurs pour atteindre lobjectif visé. Les unions cibles et les animateurs seront formés en auto-évaluation participatives des activités. Ce qui les permettrait dapprendre de leurs erreurs. Des sessions dauto-évaluations appuyées par la coordination technique  seront organisées au sein de ces unions. 

* Les activités de renforcement des capacités économiques 
La visibilité de la FEPA-B se traduit par sa capacité de mobilisation de ses ressources internes. Au cours de lannée 2011, les sensibilisations à la participation financière des activités vont se poursuivre avec les sorties dappui conseil. Il faut quà terme, les membres comprennent quune fédération qui se veut crédible comme la FEPA.B doit montrer à ses partenaires quelle est capable de mobiliser dimportantes ressources propres. Lobjectif pour 2011 est que 80% des membres soient à jour de leurs cotisations.

	Suivi des activités à tous les niveaux : local, UPPA et central

	Renforcement de la mobilisation des ressources externes 
Il est clair que dans la vision de la FEPA.B, la mobilisation des ressources financières propres est la première priorité pour mettre en uvre les actions au profit des membres. Toutefois, au regard des ambitions qui ne cessent daccroitre, il devient de plus en plus difficile de ne pas solliciter laccompagnement extérieur. 

	Ateliers  d'élaboration  de projets
Dans loptique de participer aux appels à candidatures de lUnion Européenne et à tout autre appel qui serait lancé, la FEPA.B prévoit 3 ateliers en vue délaborer les projets à soumettre pour financement.
  
	Elaboration dun plan daction triennal 2012-2014 
Le plan daction 2008-2011 arrive à terme en décembre 2011. Il sera nécessaire de disposer dun document prêt en novembre 2011 pour soumettre aux partenaires. Ce document prendra en compte les insuffisances constatées dans la mise en uvre du plan 2008-2011 et aura un souci de faire participer une fois de plus lensemble des acteurs qui sont aussi bénéficiaires des actions. 

	Tenue des rencontres régulières de la coordination
La coordination poursuivra  la  tenue régulière des rencontres toutes les 2 semaines pour partager les informations et planifier les sorties terrain. Au total, 20 rencontres seront tenues au cours de lannée.

La proposition de projet poursuit avec les activités deja en cours. Il s'agit notamment des groupes locaux PIEPP (promotion des initiatives économiques par la participation paysanne) et les groupements de femmes qui bénéficient des micro-crédit. Aussi les PEA créés au sein de la FEPA-B bénéficieront de l'appui.

L'objectif général est d'accompagner ces groupes locaux, membres de la FEPA-B en vue d'accroitre leurs capacités de production, de commercilaisation et de transformation des produits agricoles.

Public health authorities are concerned that this strain may mutate to became contagious between people. Throughout Southeast Asia and China, farmers raise poultry in small backyard flocks that scavenge around the farms and in the case of ducks in paddy fields. Ducks can carry the virus without showing clinical symptoms and it is suspected that some wild species may also form a reservoir of H5N1. The backyard poultry sector, where different species mix freely and come into direct contact with humans, therefore poses a particular risk. Governments in the region have adopted or are considering policies that call for restructuring or even eliminating the smallholder poultry sector, which could have a considerable impact on the livelihoods of poor farmers. This grant will allow researchers in Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam to examine the backyard poultry sector in their respective countries and its role in rural livelihoods.
