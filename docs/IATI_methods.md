# IATI Approaches Overview

## Word Embeddings

### Approach
Using the Gensim implementation of Word2Vec, Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) method.
Word embeddings represent all the words in a corpus in vector space, where words with similar meaning have a similar vector representation.

### Current Status
  - building the Word2Vec model from the IATI activity descriptions (not pre-built model)
  - Using 300 dimensional vectors, as suggested to be optimal in previous studies: https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf

### How to use embeddings vectors for document search
The challenge is turning the 300 dimensional vectors per word into a document search engine, matching existing documents to search input text.

Possible methods:
  1. Averaging the word vectors per document and also for the search phrase and the matching using cosine similarity.
  2. Using Word Mover's Distance (WMD), which calculates the minimum cumulative distance between two documents.
  3. Using doc2vec inplace of word2vec.

Option 1 (vector averaging) while not an advanced technique, is a widely acknowledged option and is performant, so being implemented in the code currently.
Option 2 (WMD) has proved not performant, taking several minutes to return a search result.
Option 3 (doc2vec) could evenutally be the best choice and may be implemented in future.

### Packages
- gensim.models word2vec, doc2vec

### Added value
- Should make a more advanced search engine incorporating synonyms matches to user input search terms

### Current challenges
- Some IATI activity descriptions have few words, with a mean of 17 words per entry after preprocessing.
- The suitability of the data before or after pre-processing as a word2vec or doc2vec model training set.

# Language Models

TODO @s-minhas: add text here explaining this approach.

## Elastic Search
* [Can do custom analysis at both index time and query time](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis.html)
* [Here are the ones that are supplied](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-analyzers.html)
* [Or build out your own](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-custom-analyzer.html)

### Approach

* Elastic search uses Apache Lucene.

   * according to **Lucene scoring formula**, a document would be most similar to itself due to the terms with the highest tf-idf.

* One of the query functions is more_like_this:

   * MLT: query extracts text from the input document, analyzes it, usually using the same analyzer at the field, then selects the top K terms with highest tf-idf to form a disjunctive query of these terms.

  * The fields on which to perform MLT must be indexed and of type text of keyword.


### How It works
- Acquire Raw Content
- Build the document
- Analyze the document
  - Specify which part of the text is to be indexed.
- Index the document
  - the documents need to be indexed so that the document can be retrieved based on certain keys instead of the entire content of the document.
  - the index process is similar to indexes at the end of a book (where common words are shown with their page numbers so that these words can be tracked quickly).
    - each index is comprised of multiple **shards**, which are the storage containers for your data.
    - Once your Index is created your cannot change the number of Primary shards.

### Deciding the right number of shards to use

- How much information you are going to store inside your index
- How fast/parallel you want ES to be able to write the data
- How much time you will want to wait when ES relocates your shard

### Index Mapping (Index Schema)

- There are the so-called 'field datatypes', which define the type of data your field contains. By 'field' we are meaning the value of a key inside indexed JSON Document.
- If you have JSON document like this:
```
{
    "Name": Travis,
    "Age" : 23
}
```

Each of the fields "Name" and "Age" will have their datatype (part of the Index Mapping).

If you let ElasticSearch choose the mapping for you, always double-check and make sure that the right mappings have been chosen for your scenario. You could easily check an Index mappings, by issuing ES query:

```
GET /my_test_index/_mapping?pretty
```



Currently the field data types you are able to choose from, contain:

* **basic:** text, keyword, date, long, double, boolean, ip

* **hierarchy support:** object, nested

* **special types:** geo_point, geo_shape, completion

- User Interface for Search
- Build Query
  - prepare a Query object using text which can be used to inquire index database to get the relevant details.
- Search Query
  - Using a query object, the index database is checked to get the relevant details and the content documents.
  - Common query types
      - TermQuery, TermRangeQuery, BooleanQuery, PhraseQuery, WildCardQuery, FuzzyQuery (searches documets using fuzzy implementation that is an approximate search based on the edit distance algorithm.)
      - edit distance is a way of quantifying how dissimilar two strings (e.g., words) are to one another by counting the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other. Edit distances find applications in natural language processing, where automatic spelling correction can determine candidate corrections for a misspelled word by selecting words from a dictionary that have a low distance to the word in question.

**Difference between keyword and text data types for storing your data.
* Keywords are stored as they are inside the Lucene Index
* Keyword can be sued for filtering and aggregations.  - that is imporotant if you try to do things liek 'GROUP By' or 'WHERE id = '5'"
* Keywords can be searched with Term-Level Queries like: **range, exists, regexp, wildcard**.


Other option:
- Can store Geo coordinates inside ElasticSearch.
